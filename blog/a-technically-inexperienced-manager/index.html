<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve thought deeply about how my technical inexperience impacts my abilities to manage a technical team. I think it&#8217;s a valid concern. I wrote about my thoughts on <a href="http://adamjonas.com/blog/my-take-on-maker-versus-manager/">maker vs manager</a> already, but this is a different beast. I haven&#8217;t been managing technical teams all that long and yet I have a deep rooted belief that I can be effective as an engineering manager in spite of my background.</p>

<p>I have been building teams and managing people for the bulk of my professional career. In the latter half of my twenties I ran a baseball academy in Dominican Republic. We had 30+ teenage athletes, 15 staff, two fields, dormitories, and kitchen. It was a big operation for a kid who spoken broken Spanish and never played the sport professionally. To compensate, I was a tyrant. I made all the calls and I shouldered the whole load. I constantly felt no one was doing enough. I felt like I was the only one who made sure the kids got what they needed. The staff hated me. I didn&#8217;t care. I controlled the daily schedule and the food deliveries. I checked that the grass was cut and the players weren&#8217;t sneaking out past curfew. I was scrappy and I was a hard-ass. In retrospect, I&#8217;m sorry my staff had to pay the the price for my education.  Those years burned me out. I was lonely. I was stressed. I was a single point of failure. I was a terrible version of myself and I knew I&#8217;d never do it that way again.</p>

<p>Part of my growth as a person has been to get past my own insecurities. I learned to be comfortable not knowing the answer. Once I started managing a tech team, it took me a while to understand that really good devs often <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want any people management responsibilties and so I strive to be their sh!t umbrella. I work to isolate them from the politics and meetings so that they can focus on what they do best &#8211; make magic. I would no doubt be more valuable if I had more reps, but my focus has been to strive to understand how the systems fit together and ask the right questions rather than lord over the implementation.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t fake my background. I learned to code late. It is a constraint I can&#8217;t change. While I can work to refine my instincts and up my skills, I&#8217;m at peace with the fact I will never be the CTO. At least not the traditional kind. As I age and better understand myself, I&#8217;ve learned I am more effective when learning from my reports rather than handing down instructions. Even though it doesn&#8217;t feel like it on the subway, <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/human-brain-hardwired-acts-kindness-vagus-nerve-activated-during-empathy-313020">humans are hardwired for kindness</a>. People energize me and I find satisfaction in helping a group discover cohesion. There will always be more to learn. The tech changes and so do the people. Businesses evolve demanding different kinds of leaders. But when we put people first, I&#8217;ve found the other pieces fall into place because trust and rapport create forgiveness and understanding. Or at least that&#8217;s what my experience has taught me.</p>
