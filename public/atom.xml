<p>Setting Up Octopress</p>

<p>http://octopress.org/docs/setup/</p>

<p>Had one hiccup in my system didn&#8217;t have Ruby 1.9.2 which .rvmrc file requires (https://rvm.io//workflow/rvmrc/). I had to go ahead and install it.</p>

<p>Deploying on Heroku:</p>

<p>To see on localhost:4000
rake preview</p>

<h3>To pushL:</h3>

<p>rake generate
git add .
git commit -m &#8216;site updated&#8217;
git push heroku master</p>

<p>http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/</p>

<p>That all went fairly well&#8230; though I didn&#8217;t understand all the intermediate steps. I&#8217;ll have to take closer look.</p>

    <id>http://ajonas.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/03/procs-and-lambdas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know how everything in Ruby is an object, well, as it turns out that&#8217;s not quite true. Ruby blocks are not objects! So, blocks are not objects, but you can turn them into objects without too much trouble. We do this by wrapping our block in an instance of the Proc class&#8230;
PROCS:</p>

<p>Very standard to pass along a code block to the each method</p>

<p>block_given? &#8211;> method to check whether a block was given to a method or not</p>

<p>A proc &#8211;> a nameless or anonymous block of code that can be represented as an object, can be passed around and called at will</p>

<p>E.G.&#8211;></p>

<p>class Array</p>

<p>def random_each(&amp;b)  # => with the ampersand, b essentially becomes a reference to the code block below.</p>

<p>shuffle.each do |el|</p>

<p>b.call el  #=> b is a proc</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>[1,2,3,4,5].random_each do |el|</p>

<p>puts |el|</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>You can only pass a single block to a method at one time, but you can pass multiple procs around because they are regular object like arrays or strings.</p>

<p>E.G.</p>

<p>Def run_two_procs (a, b)</p>

<p>a.call</p>

<p>b.call</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>proc1 = Proc.new do</p>

<p>puts &#8220;This is proc1&#8221;</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>proc2 = Proc.new do</p>

<p>puts &#8220;This is proc2&#8221;</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>run_two_procs proc1, proc2</p>

<p>If you have a code block, you can call it with yield, you can use the ampersand argument to convert it into a proc,</p>

<p>**if you use Proc.new without giving it a code block to assign to that Proc, Proc.new will look to see if the current scope has been passed a code block and then it will use that &#8211;> it will do it all implicitly, you don&#8217;t need to specify anything here. If it can&#8217;t find a block (e..g if you commented the block below) it raises an error. Proc.new wants a block passed directly or it implicitly picks it up from the current scope/environment.</p>

<p>Def run_block</p>

<p>p = Proc.new # **</p>

<p>p.call</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>run_block do</p>

<p>puts &#8220;Hello World&#8217;</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9 there are 4 main ways to run or call a block:</p>

<p>my_proc = Proc.new do |a|</p>

<p>puts &#8220;This is a proc and #{a} was passed along to me&#8221;</p>

<p>my_proc.call(10) #call method that passes in 10</p>

<p>my_proc.(20) #this isn&#8217;t a typo, gets converted to a call</p>

<p>my_proc[30] #</p>

<p>my_proc === 40 # triple equal is called the case equality operator, it&#8217;s primary function is used in case statements</p>

<p>several = Proc.new { |number| number > 3 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 8 }</p>

<p>none = Proc.new { |number| number == 0 }</p>

<p>case number</p>

<p>when several</p>

<p>puts &#8220;several&#8221;</p>

<p>when none</p>

<p>puts &#8220;none&#8221;</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>&#8211;>In this case the several proc is being run and if it returns true it runs the puts &#8211;> this abstracts everything away
Lambdas</p>

<p>Lambdas are much more sensitive than Procs to parameters. Much like methods, they need to receive the exact number of arguments as defined. Procs will just grab nil if nothing has been passed in.
Closures</p>

<p>In ruby a closure is like an anonymous code block, but that maintains references to local variables and were being used at the time of the definition of that code.</p>

<p>def run_proc(p)</p>

<p>p.call</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>name = &#8220;Fred&#8221;</p>

<p>print_a_name = proc { puts name } # this name doesn&#8217;t exist in the definition above. This magic is called a closure. (23 Min)</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name</p>

<p>ALSO:</p>

<p>def run_proc(p)</p>

<p>p.call</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>name = &#8220;Fred&#8221;</p>

<p>print_a_name = proc { puts name }</p>

<p>name = &#8220;John&#8221;</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name # => now this will output John because it kept a reference to the local variable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails Lecture I - July 2</p>

<p>How the web works:
-the requests we send to other servers have headers with info about the request
-you get the response with a header and the body
-the body is just text and data with HTML
-the communication happens over TCP/IP, namely HTTP
- the browser renders the HTML by making it pretty
-we use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE -</p>

<p>4 imporotant HTTP Verbs&#8211;>
GET- retrieve representation of content
POST- Submits data
PUT- Update
Delete- Deletes a specific resource</p>

<p>Convention over configuration
-we wants defaults</p>

<p>There are naming schemes such as:
all tables pl
all models are sigular
controller songs_controller.rb
views songs/</p>

<p>Gem:
pre-packaged piece of software that ruby uses</p>

<p>Config Folder&#8211;> where the configuration of our app lives
-Database.yaml- this is how we communicate the database</p>

<p>App Folder: spend most of our time in the app directory</p>

<p>MVC: (7:42 pm)
Models: define how data is created, retrieved, updated and deleted&#8211;> the only code that defined these 4 actions are in the model</p>

<p>Controllers: where to send the data to
business logic</p>

<p>Views: display logic</p>

<p>Helpers: helper functions for your views
db: stores your database and all the instructions for your database</p>

<p>lib: code that you app needs but isn&#8217;t part of the request cycle
-tasks- background tasks</p>

<p>public dir:
any code that doesn&#8217;t require the rails stack to run</p>

<p>vendor: any 3rd party library that you didn&#8217;t write
&#8211; similar to the lib directory that you didn&#8217;t write</p>

<p>REST:
-Representational State Transfer
-URL: unifeied resources locators
- there should be a unified way to expose resources to the world
-1st concept: the things we get online are resources&#8211; what the server is going to respond with is a representation of the real thing (since it can&#8217;t deliver the real thing)
-there should be consistency and predictability-</p>

<p>rails generate resource song title:string duration:integer #always singular
rails generate scaffold song title:string #in the beginning the first few resources are created by scaffolds</p>

<p>MIGRATION: defines a db strcuture
every resource has it&#8217;s own table</p>

<p>SQL: server query language or standard query language</p>

<p>SCHEMA- describes the structure of the DB</p>

<p>RAKE: a ruby library to run background tasks
rake stats&#8211; gives me stats on the app
rake about&#8211;> outputs info about the environment, etc
rake -T &#8211;> outputs provides commands</p>

<p>VIDEO 2&#8230;</p>

<p>migrations are iterative by nature
every migration should one and only one thing</p>

<p>rake db:migrae runs the migration
rake db:rollback rolls back the migration</p>

<p>OBJECT ORIENTATION
-what to create metaphors in our code to representations of the real world</p>

<p>Song.find(2) #=> finds the object of id 2
Song.all #=> returns all the instances of the class</p>

<p>ORM: object relational mappers
- a class is to a table : an instance of a class is to a row of a table
-every instance is going to wrap a row of a table
-one to one relationship between an instance and a row
-the library, the ORM, allows you to relate to the objects with knowing how the objects are related</p>

<p>Programming is just codifying procedural knowledge</p>

Rails Guides: more like how-tos
Rails API: the more technical version</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t found great explanations for this yet but there is a video below&#8230;</p>

<p>The tap method is available to all Ruby objects and serves as a way to have a block &#8220;act on&#8221; the method&#8217;s caller and return the object called. Per the Ruby docs, &#8220;the primary purpose of this method is to &#8216;tap into&#8217; a method chain, in order to perform operations on intermediate results within the chain&#8221;. For some examples on using tap see MenTaLguY&#8217;s post on Eavesdropping on Expressions. As he says in his post, &#8220;you can insert your code just about anywhere without disturbing the flow of data.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having some trouble following all this&#8230; Matt Stopa has a video below that is more for a beginner.</p>

David Black
June 26, 2012</p>

<p>Enumerators
- what is an enum?
- an instance of class Enum
-external iterator
-iterates via a specific method on an underlying object</p>

<p>??next method- walk through the iteration and give you the next value</p>

<p>the default bound is the each method
%w &#8211;> converst to enum</p>

<p>loop resuces the stop Iteration error
??each_cons method
if you run each on enum = array.map # => it behaves like map
same with array.select and array.each_cons</p>

<p>Can also chain enumerators:</p>

<p>array.each.with_index #=> will yield the index
array.map.with_index</p>

<p>String Enumerables
-bytes (aka each_byte)
-chars (aka each_char)
-lines (aka each_line)</p>

<p>count takes a block (how many is this true for&#8230;)</p>

<p>?? diff between take and select
ENUM METHODS:
.extend(Enumerable) #=> extends the Enum functionality if operating on a single object</p>

<p>each_slice doesn&#8217;t overlap like each_cons</p>

<p>There is a Prime class (require &#8216;prime&#8217;)</p>

<p>array.any? &#8211;> is there anything True in this array?
array.none?
array.one? (just one&#8211; will exit after it&#8217;s first hit)
array.all?</p>

<p>array = [a,3,2,4,5,6,7]
array.partition {block that calls the even method} #=> wtih divide the result into two arrays a true an other
array.slice_before #=> [[1,3], [2], [4,5,7], [6]]
chunk discards results for which the block evaluates to nil #=> not useful- obscure method
array.take
array.drop</p>

<p>take_while #=> e.g. while true execute below
drop_while</p>

<p>array = [1,2,3]
array.permutation.to_a # => yields all the permuatations of the array [[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3]]
array.combination(2).to_a #=> yields the combinations (in this case 2 at a time [1,2], [1,3], [2,3])</p>

<p>array.sample #=> pulls a random sample from the array
array.shuffle # => will randomize the sample</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Strategy&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8211;>look for nouns to start
url- unified resource locator

<p>HOW TO BUILD CLASS METHODS
methods that don&#8217;t apply to the instance of the class but the class itself
you can tell if it&#8217;s a class method if self is the receiver</p>

<p>class Artist
puts self</p>

<p>def self.top_5

<p>end</p>

<p>def self.top_5
self.all.sort_by{|a| a.rank}

<p>class Artist
@@all = []
attr_accessor :name, :songs, :artists</p>

<p>def initialize
@@all &lt;&lt; self
(#) @songs = []
(#) @artists = []
end
(#)important pattern of observing intialization and making classes intelligent</p>

<p>(# def songs

(# end</p>

<p>def self.all
@@all #return all the artists ever created

MODULES - for creating all sort of shared behavior
- modules don&#8217;t have instances&#8211;> the difference between modules and classes</p>

<p>two keywords to include behavior&#8211;> include and extend
diff between include and extend &#8211;> trying to describe the scope of the module behavior</p>

<p>extending- makes it a class methods
include &#8211;> methods in that module are instance methods
?? how does require fit into this??</p>

<p>3:38
?? order of attr_accessor and @@all? does it matter?</p>

<p>INHERITANCE &#8211; a pattern that we don&#8217;t like as much as modules
we&#8217;d rather think of things in the builder pattern using include and extend</p>

<p>2nd HALF</p>

<p>File Systems:</p>

<p>Dir documentation (4:10)
foreach and Dir.entries</p>

<p>ERB templates (4:23):
we care about the result method for templating</p>

<p>PRIVATE AND PUBLIC METHODS (4:41)</p>

<h2>-a private method cannot be called with an explicit receiever, only implicit receivers&#8211; means they can only be called in the class</h2>

<p>GEMS:
-a pre-built package or functionality</p>

<p>ruby-toolbox.com</p>

<p>SINATRA (4:44):
-based on rack (the first )
RACK - create a class that responds to a method called &#8216;call&#8217;
- the response must return 3 three things- a status code, the header, the body of the response</p>

<p>Ruby 1.8.7 is the standard version that&#8217;s loaded on the OS X Lion</p>

<p>Some lessons&#8211; Xcode did not come loaded with the GNU Compiler Collection out of the box (AKA out of app store). (-bash: gcc: command not found) See: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/</p>

<p>Anyways this had to be loaded to run anything like Homebrew.</p>

<ul>
<li>All OSs except for window are a NIX: A Unix-like (sometimes referred to as UN<em>X or </em>nix) operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a Unix system, while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the Single UNIX Specification. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)</li>
</ul>


<p>Once it was installed we got the result: i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2: no input files from the gcc command. (read more about gcc here: http://gcc.gnu.org/)</p>

<p>Homebrew was installed from: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation</p>

<p>-Homebrew replaced the old style of loading software which required configuring the config file since all OSs are customized with different versions. This is frustrating as hell. Jewelry box, RVM, and homebrew are powerful enough to take the grunt work out of the environment set-up, but can&#8217;t the community find a way to wrap this in an app in the app store? Is this feasible?</p>

<p>Jewelry Box was installed from http://jewelrybox.unfiniti.com/</p>

<p>wget was installed from: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/</p>

<p>Alfred was installed from: http://www.alfredapp.com/</p>

<p>We also modfiied the bash profile or dot files from Avi&#8217;s github repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He mentioned that in the future I should choose a user name with all lower case letters rather than the capitalized name that I chose.</p></li>
<li><p>I also needed to create a symbolic link for my sublime text editor so that I can call it from the command line (this is something I never figured out on my Fedora 15 system)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So for those keeping track at home:</p>

<pre><code>GCC
Homebrew
Jewelry box
RVM
Ruby Update
Rails
</code></pre>

<p>No MySQL or anything like that&#8230; until I need it.</p>

<p>This is a good post on what to load up:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(FROM THE VIDEO)</p>

<p>diff between each and map (map reduce)- 12min:30</p>

<p>while each will only return to you the array
map will return a modified version of the array&#8217;s element based on the operation&#8211; will save the result in a new array
each will simply execute the block</p>

<p>another syntax for blocks:
do / end (better for multi line) as well as curly braces {}- better for single line</p>

<p>how map works with a block 19min:19</p>

<p>Iterators (AKA finder methods) and blocks:
detect- (also works like find)
when you want to find the first of something in an enumerable
after it finds an element that makes the block true is stops iterating</p>

<p>select is like detect but wont stop</p>

<p>reject returns an array for items in self for which the block is NOT TRUE.</p>

<p>all will return true as long as all the element pass what&#8217;s in the block</p>

<p>any- like all but less specific</p>

<p>none is the opposite of all</p>

<p>Sort and Sort By: (34 min)</p>

<p>REG EX PATTERNS- /w+/ - not space characters
(/a|e|i|o|u/) - vowels</p>

<p>&lt;=> spaceship operator</p>

<p>(42MIN) return values&#8211; it&#8217;s the last expression evaluated
but there is an explicit return keyword
?? can the return keyword go on a diferent line rather than the last line?</p>

<p>46 min 30 Object Orientation</p>

<p>prime method 51 min
completed at 57 min
Big O notation is used to compare the efficiency of algorithms
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation and
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alfredth/archive/2006/08/24/717085.aspx</p>

<p>Ranges:
a..c &#8211;> a, b, c
a&#8230;c &#8211;> a, b</p>

<p>equal? method works by comparing object ids</p>

<p>an instance is an occurance, a member of the species</p>

<p>setter methods (1 hr 8 Min)</p>

<p>instance variable (1 hr 10 min)
local to the instance they are created in</p>

<p>initialization &#8211;> def initialize (1 hr 20min)</p>

<p>Constants - have a more global scope&#8211; either one letter capital or all capitals
shouldn&#8217;t reassign constants once they have been assigned
we use upper case letters for class names, because it is a constants
ALL UPPERCASE are reserved for global variables</p>

<p>:: Ruby syntax for name spacing</p>

<p>Global variables begin with $, but you should never use them&#8230; they aren&#8217;t neccessary</p>

<p>For further reading on Variable Scope see:
http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Variable_Scope (1 hr 30 min)</p>

<p>puts- what is the receiver of puts?
- the implicit receiever of puts is self (1 hr 32 min)</p>

<p>accessor_writer
accessor_reader
accessor_attr (1 hr 36)</p>

<p>E.G. teaching dogs how to compare to other dogs (1hr 37)</p>

<p>E.G. can make strings case insensitve (1 hr 39)</p>

    <link href="http://ajonas.heroku.com/blog/2012/06/10/lecture-2-ruby-lecture-video-notes/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-10T10:37:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajonas.heroku.com/blog/2012/06/10/lecture-2-ruby-lecture-video-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Programmer _Why
-We don&#8217;t speak machine. Coders are not translators. We need to teach the machine to speak like us.</p>

<p>There shouldn&#8217;t be anything in code that you don&#8217;t understand.
-Code is composed of the language, the name that you give things
-The language is just a bunch of keywords that have reserved meaning (10 min)- you can&#8217;t use them for anything else</p>

<p>-Names
-Varaiables- store references to things. (they are lowercase and are previously undefined)- they are pointers/make references to data
&#8220;The beginning of wisdom is calling things by its right name&#8221;
Data- literals
strings- indicate that the following characters should not be interpretted as code, but are rather just pieces of data (13min)</p>

<p>=> comment followed by hash rocket means &#8216;should return&#8217;
(TIP- control L clears your terminal window)</p>

<p>Going over the quiz (14 min)</p>

<p>ruby -c &#8211;> ruby c flag, checks to the see if the program even works</p>

<p>When I debug code, it is a forensic process</p>

<p>Read code outloud</p>

<p>def is a keyword
ArgumentError is raised the wrong number of parameters are passed to a method
NameError occurs when Ruby encounters a word that was previously undefined- like an english word
Synatax error occurs when something you submitted breaks the compiler- like a floating plus sign</p>

<p>mate cmd r runs the code
subl cmd b runs the code
Comparisons (28 min):</p>

<p>true and false are the atoms of programs, they are the protons and electrons of the universe</p>

<p>(33 min) the single equal are reserved for assignment and the double equals are for comparison
&#8220;test&#8221; == &#8220;TEST&#8221; is false
!= is the not equal operator
&#8211;> these allow us to evaluate whether something is true or false</p>

<p>(36min) escape character \ e.g.
&#8221;
&#34;In the beginning..&#8221;
&#8221;</p>

<p>Branching (38 min)
if, else, end branch (39 min)
- the moment it encounters a truth, it is going to stop running the branches
every if statement does not require an else clause</p>

<p>in ruby everything is an expression, which means that everything must evaluate into a return value so you can even use if statements as an expression in itself (42 min)
if statement assignment- we are using an if statement to control the value of a variable</p>

<p>elsif (45 min)
every branch of an if statement operates independently of the other branches. therefore you can evaluate if x&#8230; elsif y&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t matter</p>

<p>it&#8217;s always going to boil down to one value&#8211; even if it is 6 or 7 lines of code in the end it can only equal one thing &#8211; expressions however are composed of subexpressions&#8211; that the basis of compositon (49 min)</p>

<p>-also have the unless keyword &#8211; which is the converse of the if keyword&#8211; this isn&#8217;t preferred&#8211; prefer the negation usually</p>

<p>Logic (50 min)
- once we have true and false, and we have expressions (like 1 &lt; 2), and we have if statments then we have all the ingredients for logical equations</p>

<p>the OR operator ||
x = 2
if (x/2 == 1) || (x == 1) &#8211; as long as one of the expressions evaluates to true, then it passes</p>

<p>The only thing that evaluates to false is nil (absence of expression) and false</p>

<p>0 is true, 4 is true, &#8220;string&#8221; is true
x = false || 4 &#8211;> this will return 4 &#8211;>> this will assign x to 4</p>

<p>x = 1 || 2 &#8211;> x will equal one because the moment it encounters a true statement it stops executing the rest of the code</p>

<p>the AND operator &amp;&amp;
for an AND operator to be true, both sides of the equation must be true
so y = false &amp;&amp; puts &#8216;hello&#8217; &#8211;> it will not even get to the puts statement because once it encounters the false it stops evaluating the expressions</p>

<p>negation operator !
SWITCHING (1 hr 4min)- switching between conditions
if statement can get verbose and confusing and sometimes they aren&#8217;t good for checking multiple related conditions</p>

<p>case x
when, else, end
unlike an if statement, a case statement is locked to the object you send it
e.g. case x
x == 1
y == 4 #this will be compared to x</p>

<p>you can combine &amp;&amp; and || operators.</p>

<p>x = 1 if 1 &lt; 2 #=> x = 1
x = 1 if 2 &lt; 1 #=> nil (1 hr 16 min)</p>

<p>PART 2 Video
Running through the exercises</p>

<p>(10 min)
q = &#8220;a&#8221;
when q.downcase == &#8220;a&#8221; #=> this is eval as false.
puts &#8220;its a vowel&#8221;</p>

<p>q = &#8220;a&#8221;
when &#8220;a&#8221;
puts &#8220;it&#8217;s a vowel&#8221; #=> this is the way to do it</p>

<p>LOOPING (12min 30 sec)
if statements and case statements area how we control flow so that the program is not just stupidly linear - we can have conditions and ambiguity
another way to do this with loops
-the simpliest loop is with the while keyword
- it is check a condition or expression and until that expression evaluates to true it will run that code</p>

<p>x = 1
while x &lt; 10
puts x
x += 1 #=> will increment x by 1. just like x = x + 1
end
the break keyword will exit the current loop &#8211;> 23 min</p>

<p>if I have an unexpected end &#8211; you have a dangling end, but you often don&#8217;t know where&#8230; this is why indentation is so important</p>

<p>tabs are meaningful characters and spaces aren&#8217;t &#8211; use spaces for indentation NOT tabs</p>

<p>until &#8211; is the converse of the while loop&#8211; we don&#8217;t like until loops as much as while</p>

<p>-also have the until keyword &#8211; until x == 1 is the same as while x != 1 #=> this isn&#8217;t preferred, usually like the negation of while&#8211; in some situations it is appropriate. unless and until are the safron of keywords. Use them sparingly!!</p>

<p>->encountered 5 types thus far&#8211;> strings, intergers, floats, nil and false</p>

<p>ARRAYS- (26min)&#8211; an indexed collection of objects&#8211; a type to hold other values
the literal for an array is []
- if you miss a comma [1, 2 3]&#8211;> you will get a syntax error
- for array [1, 2, 3][0]&#8211;> this indexes the first slot. Remember that it states counting at the zero element
-accessing a position in an array (33 min)</p>

<p>puts days_of_the_week[(days_of_the_week.size-1)] #=> will return the 6th element
weekdays = days_of_the_week[1, 5] &#8211;> this is a range of position one to five</p>

<p>arrays in Ruby are elastic (52 min)</p>

<p>a = [[1, 2], &#8220;a&#8221;]
a[0] # => [1,2]
a[0][1] => 2</p>

<p>RECEIVERS (55 min)
-Ruby is an object oriented language so that means that everything is an object. We interact with objects by sending them methods using methods</p>

<p>slice(0,2) # => this slices out the first 3 elements
concat(&#8220;uth&#8221;) # => this appends &#8220;uth&#8221; to the end</p>

<p>chomp and slice are out periodic elements (1hr 8 min)</p>

<p>STRING METHODS:
strip gets rid of both leading and trailing spaces
lstrip - rid of leading spaces
tstrip - trailing spaces</p>

<p>puts &#8220;of Least Surprise&#8221;.insert[0, &#8220;Principle&#8221;] => inserts Principle at position 0</p>

<p>gsub (1hr 16min)- global substitution - takes two arguments (the pattern, the replacement value)</p>

<p>Booleans-
puts&#8221;&#8220;.empty? #=> true
put &#8221; &#8220;.empty? #=> false</p>

<p>eql?, starts_with?, include?</p>

<p>Return Methods (1hr 18min)-
to_i
size
next &#8211;> next thing in a sequence. puts &#8220;a&#8221;.next # => &#8220;b&#8221;</p>

<p>puts &#8220;one, two&#8221;.slice(0,3) #=> one &#8211;> start at position one and give me 3 characters</p>

<p>match &#8211;> the first occurance of the match
scan &#8211;> scan will return all occurances &#8211;> returns an array of objects</p>
