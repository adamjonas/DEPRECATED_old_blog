    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I was a web developer, I spent my time on baseball fields helping teenagers realize their ultimate dream of playing in the Major Leagues. All of them had talent. Somewhere, someone had seen glimpses of it. Cultivating that talent and turning their potential into performance was the primary purpose of my job. In the vast majority of cases we failed. Now, a few years removed from the game, most of the players I worked with are out of professional baseball. Those who did succeed, found a way to endure the grind and adjusted to the game’s mental and emotional demands.</p>

<p>In 2012, I hit the reset button on my career and became a web developer. I thought I would be leaving baseball forever. However, I found that many of the same traits I saw in successful ball players, even those with very little formal schooling, were some of the very same characteristics I observed in talented engineers. The inability to manage failure, maintain consistency, and learn how to be a professional shattered the dreams of the vast majority players I worked with because they were skills that were so difficult to master.</p>

<p>When I see one of them on TV, it’s hard to not recall the younger, yet unmolded version. It is why I was never the best scout. The baseball scout’s job is to imagine the possibilities. They envision a future version of a gangly youth whose body and mind has matured and whose flaws have been smoothed away to the point they can perform in the Major Leagues. It is a hard job and one that I wish existed in other industries.</p>

<h2>Facing failure</h2>

<p>Successful people, in any field, often struggle with making mistakes. This isn’t surprising, we are wired for bad news. We internalize it. We personalize it. Repeated failure is exhausting. Ball players, whose hitting success rate is at best around 30% are forced to cope. Failure is inherently part of the game.</p>

<p>Resilient players’ confidences seem immune to repeated failure. In fact, failure appears to be inextricably linked to their progress. This makes sense. We improve fastest based on negative feedback. The great thing about that big red error message is that it leaves an obvious clue. Sometimes these hints are more obscure than others, but bugs and errors inform us where to look and where to improve.</p>

<p>Getting repeatedly beaten by the same pitch provides feedback on where hitters need to improve in the same way that a familiar error in our terminal window instructs us where in the code to start looking for our mistake. As humans we learn through repetition and experience. The goal is to not getting beaten again by the same pitch or the same problem.</p>

<p>When I first started learning to program, I focused on never repeating the same mistake twice. This, of course, is impossible but I recorded most my thoughts and posted it online so that I had a searchable collection of my mistakes. The frequency of my posts have waned, but I still find myself searching my blog archives when I know I’ve solved a similar problem in the past. While it was rare to see ball players jot down notes on opponents, most hitting savants have the ability recall previous pitch sequences from past at-bats. Either way, the secret to coping with failure is to reframe it as valuable feedback to be used in the future.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>As developers, we know that consistent performance is important. We construct our dependencies on the most stable parts of our applications. The same goes for managers: when Sarah demonstrates she can be depended on to meet deadlines on a day-to-day, week-to-week, sprint-to-sprint or quarter-to-quarter basis, Sarah can be relied on to build the feature to satisfy the high priority business objective.</p>

<p>Consistency creates the opportunity for measurement. Like the measurement of feature velocity based on a set period of time, comparison of player’s abilities would be worthless without a standard 162 game schedule where the participants play nine innings with nine players on the field. Without a level playing field, comparisons are no longer valid and people can get really upset (see baseball and steroids).</p>

<p>Consistency is difficult because we are wired to break free from it. We are not as perfectly repeatable as the scripts we write. Our brains thrive on novelty. The day-to-day becomes mundane without it. We seek out adventure and variety. We create drama where there is none. We endeavor to learn new things.</p>

<p>But mostly being consistent is just showing up. Being there when products ship and stuff goes down. Career defining highlights are created when people are in the right place at the right time. Crashes on the production server and DEFCON 1 bugs are inevitable but these panic moments create opportunities. Under pressure, acting as you always do makes you a hero.</p>

<p>Derek Jeter’s lifetime batting average was .310. A consummate professional, he hit .308 in the playoffs. Just being yourself when the pressure is on and more eyes are on you makes it seem like you are rising to the occasion. No one is perfect, but bringing your best everyday provides predictability to our human unpredictability and separates the amateurs from the pros.</p>

<h2>Professionalism</h2>

<p>Professional baseball is a child’s game played by overgrown men who make millions of dollars. Make no mistake about it, baseball is a grueling sport. The schedule is relentless. Players arrive at the stadium five-plus hours before the first pitch to weight train, stretch, hit, throw, review scouting reports, etc.</p>

<p>After a three hour game, players are expected to hold court in front of their lockers and answer questions that essentially boil down to, “Tell us about your glaring mistake that you made in front of thousands of people across America.” Each major league team plays 162 games in about 180 days &#8211; not to mention the the month of spring training before the season starts and, if they are lucky, a month of postseason games. Eighty-one of these games in other cities meaning players are switching time zones for weeks on end. The truly blessed ones do this for 20+ years. What the casual fan sees of a player on any given night is the result of thousands of hours of refining subtle movements through exhaustive repetition.</p>

<p>And while we developers don’t enjoy the fame and fortune of Major Leaguers, we get to solve the worlds’ hardest puzzles. The impact of our code has touched the lives of nearly every human on the planet. The drudgery of implementing the vision of others is offset by the natural builder’s high.</p>

<p>Hacker News is littered with discussion on how writing software can crush your soul, but for the lucky ones, the “job” retains its joy. Despite the jeering fans and elusive bugs, there are a blessed few who simply love what they do.</p>

<h2>The Same But Different</h2>

<p>Of course, there are stark differences between baseball and software engineering. Software has been in the hands of laymen for less than a generation and baseball has remained unchanged since before the Civil War. While software’s impact continues to accelerate, we should pause to take breathers and remember that what is old becomes new again. There are lessons to learn everywhere we look and baseball has proven no different for me.</p>

<p>I love what I do. I’ve never been as challenged as when I’m muddling to make sense of a new concept or totally lost in a self-created code mess. The wins and losses I’ve experienced as a developer are like nothing else I’ve experienced as an athlete or a coach. While I’m still a relatively new programmer, my experiences in baseball have transferred as valuable lessons on coping with failures, reliability, and professionalism.</p>

<p>Not all that long ago my work day consisted of spotting the subtle deficiencies in a pitcher’s delivery and the sound of a shortstop’s feet as he ran a 60 yard dash, but when I watch how a junior dev deftly uses her VIM shortcuts or the ease of which she writes a complex SQL query, I’m reminded it’s not so different after all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was a <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/2013/11/the-new-visionaries-kris-gale/">great interview</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.theresponsiveorg.com/manifesto">Responsive Organization</a></h2>

<h2>Evaluation is a busted idea</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>&#8220;It’s my opinion that the big company evaluation systems we all think of have been broken for a very long time. Long before Drive came out, W. Edwards Deming was practically yelling at the world that performance evaluations were a busted idea.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Remember that annual bonus money is not free money that comes into existence when a company decides to give bonuses. Bonuses are, effectively, a group of people agreeing to give up a percentage of their salary for their managers to redistribute to the people those managers arbitrarily select. What sane group of people would agree to that?&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;Bonus-tied reviews by the management layer reduce an organization’s ability to change direction, because it incentivizes people to deliver what they’ve committed to, even as new information suggests different work would be more effective.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;It’s interesting that everyone asks about the evaluation process. I think that’s a really strong signal that most engineers don’t work in structures or environments that provide enough transparency.&#8221;</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the author of <a href="http://leadingsnowflakes.com/">leading snowflakes</a>.</p>

<h2>Q &amp; A</h2>

<p>  Q: do you insulate devs from business objectives so they can concentrate on their task or let them understand the big picture so that they buy in?</p>

<p>  A: Juniors need to be execution machines. KPIs filter down to the technical lead and engineering leads.</p>

<p>  Q: How would you approach evaluations in general?</p>

<p>  A: Need to let go of the idea that evaluations are purely objective. You want them to fit culturally and grow. If they are accomplishing these goals they should be rewarded and if not are way off, they should be fired.</p>

<h2>Notes from discussion with Oren</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn from your peers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a list of ppl that do things well. Pick their brain on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expectations</p>

<ul>
<li>What are must have qualites and what are deal breakers?</li>
<li>What makes your tick?

<ul>
<li>I work best when___</li>
<li>It annoys me when ___</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>write down a charge&#8217;s 6 month performance today

<ul>
<li>if you really have a solid foundation of trust, share it with them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Own thoughts</h2>

<p>  Personal preferences are based on YOUR preferences &#8211; I had misinteerpreted what they represented in the book. But why should your charges adjust to you, rather than the other way around?</p>

<p>  The book&#8217;s perspective seems to be for teams little bit larger team than what we have (currently 7) - so I&#8217;m interested in your thoughts on goals for small teams before WE REALLY DON&#8217;T NEED A REPORTING STRUCTURE when things are pretty messy still and people have to do a lot of things (like a startup), but we still want to give inexperienced developers some structure.</p>

<pre><code>- baseline expectations - which we have done and they are soft (passion, 'getting it done', making the 'right' technical decision) - so they are subjective
- Personal expectations - technical risks, technical growth
</code></pre>

<p>  This is all pretty soft and that means that performance is pretty subjective which makes it pretty hard to align goals with our future direction or OKRs.</p>

<p>  site speed? user acquisition? We aren&#8217;t close to that.</p>

<p>  If you could pick one and only one metric to systematically increase over time, what metric would have the greatest and most sustainable impact on you and your team’s effectiveness?
  But these quantitative number really can&#8217;t be all of it&#8230;</p>

<p>  Helping others, code review, their code is breaking seem like more appropriate and directly pertinent to a dev&#8217;s day to day performance.</p>

<h3>Notes from <a href="http://vimeo.com/95932458">Docker: The Revolution Will Be Containerized</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Containers are just other Linux processes on the host not virtualized calls</li>
<li>The only performance decrease you see is Linux asking whether it is allowed to access this file - share a kernel with the host</li>
<li><p>Not nested virtualization</p>

<ul>
<li>this would be slow</li>
<li>no device emulation, which makes it faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Can be used as a light weight vm but that&#8217;s not the only way</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>Chroot</code> on steroids?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>(From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">Wikipedia</a>) A <code>chroot</code> on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children.</p></li>
<li><p>A chroot environment can be used to create and host a separate virtualized copy of the software system. This can be useful for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Testing and development</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A test environment can be set up in the chroot for software that would otherwise be too risky to deploy on a production system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dependency control</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Software can be developed, built and tested in a chroot populated only with its expected dependencies. This can prevent some kinds of linkage skew that can result from developers building projects with different sets of program libraries installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Legacy software or software using a different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">application binary interface</a> must sometimes be run in a chroot because their supporting libraries or data files may otherwise clash in name or linkage with those of the host system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should a system be rendered unbootable, a chroot can be used to move back into the damaged environment after bootstrapping from an alternate root file system (such as from installation media, or a Live CD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Privilege separation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Programs are allowed to carry open file descriptors (for files, pipelines and network connections) into the chroot, which can simplify jail design by making it unnecessary to leave working files inside the chroot directory. This also simplifies the common arrangement of running the potentially vulnerable parts of a privileged program in a sandbox, in order to pre-emptively contain a security breach. Note that chroot is not necessarily enough to contain a process with root privileges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cgroups</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Cgroups</a>)is a Linux kernel feature to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups.</li>
<li>Cgroups also provides namespace isolation to completely isolate application&#8217;s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user ids and mounted file systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>LXC (LinuX Containers)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC">LXC</a> provides operating system-level virtualization through a virtual environment that has its own process and network space, instead of creating a full-fledged virtual machine.</li>
<li>The Linux kernel comprises cgroups for resource isolation (CPU, memory, block I/O, network, etc.) that does not require starting any virtual machines.</li>
<li>LXC combines cgroups and namespace support to provide an isolated environment for applications. Docker can also use LXC as one of its execution drivers, enabling image management and providing deployment services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CoreOS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreOS">CoreOS</a> is an open source lightweight operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed for providing infrastructure to clustered deployments, while focusing on automation, ease of applications deployment, security, reliability and scalability. As an operating system, CoreOS provides only the minimal functionality required for deploying applications inside software containers, together with built-in mechanisms for service discovery and configuration sharing.</li>

<h2>Nginx Push State</h2>

<p>https://gist.github.com/loganhasson/c8bfff2767ea74187cf0</p>

<h2>Enter Heroku</h2>

<p>Clearly keeping a threaded server open with the warning below is not ideal:</p>

<blockquote><p>Long-polling and streaming responses</p></blockquote>

<p>Cedar supports HTTP 1.1 features such as long-polling and streaming responses. An application has an initial 30 second window to respond with a single byte back to the client. However, each byte transmitted thereafter (either received from the client or sent by your application) resets a rolling 55 second window. If no data is sent during the 55 second window, the connection will be terminated.</p>

<p>If you’re sending a streaming response, such as with server-sent events, you’ll need to detect when the client has hung up, and make sure your app server closes the connection promptly. If the server keeps the connection open for 55 seconds without sending any data, you’ll see a request timeout.</p>

<ul>

    <updated>2014-06-17T18:49:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/presenter-objects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>From our PR thread</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A presenter object is a simply a PORO (plain ol&#8217; ruby object), constructed by the controller out of the data of one or more models, whose attributes serve the view
layer. So in our case we give a view a <code>LessonPresenter</code> that has a <code>css_class</code> attribute and remove all decision making from the view layer (which is the ideal goal).</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;service&#8221; object, it&#8217;s a presenter so it would go in the <code>presenters</code> folder. This is also sometimes called a &#8220;view model&#8221; or a &#8220;view object&#8221;. The word &#8220;presenter&#8221; is overloaded a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>This an interesting read on a few <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/"><code>model refactoring patterns</code></a>:</p></li>
<li><p>So instead of a collection of Lessons at the view level, you&#8217;d be dealing with a collection of LessonPresenters or similar. Alternatively, you can just put that method on the lesson object itself, which is simpler and more straightforward but not strictly Single Responsibility Principle/Seperation of Concerns/Model View Controller compliant. tradeoffs.</p></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Is it a terrible idea to have LessonPresenter inherit from Lesson?</p></blockquote>

<p>A: Strictly speaking in terms of OO, inheritance describes an &#8220;is-a&#8221; relationship, and you can&#8217;t say that a lessonpresenter is a lesson, so introducing an inheritance chain is probably inappropriate. There is some duplication to this pattern. Typically a viewmodel exposes only the attributes needed to satisfy the needs of the view, and you&#8217;d fill them in from the corresponding model on construction.</p>

<p>While this seems on the surface to violate DRY (and be duplicate work), i&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s no more repetition than creating factories with the same attributes as models. Separate objects for separate purposes.</p>

<p>You could get away with hanging a lesson off of the presenter so that you could access it at the view level, but that&#8217;s a law of demeter violation and breaks encapsulation.</p>

<p>You could do the method_missing bit and delegate to the object. that&#8217;s slick and rubyish. Where that falls apart though is implementing this pattern across more than one model. Because we&#8217;re not really building a &#8220;presenter for a lesson&#8221;, we&#8217;re building a presentation object for a view that represents the model data behind it.</p>

<p>Already this answer is complicated, but there&#8217;s just always a lot of decisions that go into making architectural choices. It may be the case that for this one thing, creating a method on the Lesson itself is the &#8220;simplest thing that could possibly work&#8221; and satisfies one of our tenets of agile, and then we delay the big architectural choice until we need a second or third thing.</p>

<p>I support whichever choice you make (probably) as long as you have unit tests to support later refactoring :smile_cat:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Context</code> describes an execution context, or an arrangement of the system, not an action.</li>

<p>The layout is like this:</p>

<ul>

    <id>http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/rails-4-csrf-handling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Right now we are building &#8220;Ironboard&#8221; (title is WIP) &#8211; an application that makes makes consuming prework a breeze for students and creating and organizing prework a breeze for teachers. This application is going to fit into a workflow that kicks off when a student pays their deposit. The short version is that another internal app is going to ping an endpoint on Ironboard, which internally will generate an email invitation and enroll that student in course so that the instructor can track their progress.</p>

<h2>CSRF</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html">rails security guide</a>. I searched <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16258911/rails-4-authenticity-token">stackoverflow</a> and quite frankly the documentation for handling CSRF in rails 4 is sucky. <a href="http://alexcoco.com/forgery-protection-strategy/">Alex Coco</a> seems to have done the most documentation here. Buried in all of this is the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/2/8/csrf-protection-bypass-in-ruby-on-rails/">proper way to handle cross-domain requests</a> in 2011:</p>

<blockquote><p>Users can override this behaviour by overriding <code>handle_unverified_request</code> in their own controllers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most answers that are out there have to do with disabling the <code>protect_from_forgery</code> method in a specfic controller for a specific action. This hides csrf vulnerability, but I&#8217;m not sure that disabling token authenticity makes things any better. Why use <code>protect_from_forgery except: :ping_from_registrar</code> when we could use the <code>handle_unverified_request</code></p>

<p>We ended up using:</p>
