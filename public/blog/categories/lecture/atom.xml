<h3>Object Orientation</h3>

<p>once you have a user class, you can send it a message
once you have a class you can teach the class how to do things like authenticate a user</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>iteration: going through many things one at a time
we refer to that character one at a time, as the iterator or yield</p>

<p>.inspect allows you to look at an object that</p>

<p>common to have nested iteration-- iterate through them, by looping through enumerables within a loop</p>

<p>Iterating a hash you get yielded two variables at once, the key first and the value second</p>

<p>``` ruby
alphabet = {:a => 1, :b => 2}</p>

<p>alphabet.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} is the #{value} letter"
end
```</p>

<p>.compact will get rid of any nil values
.uniq will get rid of duplicates</p>

<p>! methods will change the data set forever...</p>

<p>.flatten will remove nesting from an array-- will flatten all elements in array
.reverse elements in the array</p>

<p>side note: python believes there is one way to do something. Ruby believes there should be many ways to do it so that you can be more expressive.</p>

<p><code>ruby ordinalize is a integer method
1.ordinalize     # =&gt; "1st"
2.ordinalize     # =&gt; "2nd"
1002.ordinalize  # =&gt; "1002nd"
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby multiple_of?(number)</p>

<h1>Check whether the integer is evenly divisible by the argument.</h1>

<p>0.multiple_of?(0)  #=> true
6.multiple_of?(5)  #=> false
10.multiple_of?(2) #=> true
```</p>

<p>Lab solution (8PM)</p>

<p>hash structure with root or without root TODO</p>

<p>.detect, .select and .reject methods are all useful array elements</p>

<p>class CONSTANTS are really good for storing data about the class</p>

Kent Beck</p>

<p>FizzBuzz
solutions on ?ruberque?</p>

<p>TDD: able to write the code that you wish you had</p>

<p><strong>Array Review:</strong></p>

<p>empty[0] = "filled" #=> can assign slots one at a time
easy_as[1, 5] #=> can slice elements off, have elastic arrays --> can add elements to an array without doing anything else</p>

<p><strong>Lecture:</strong></p>

<p>Object orientation- we send object methods
important to identify who the receiver is and what the method is
part of dot notation: every method returns an object, so you can chain another method on it
it's the return of the previous method that is the receiver for the following method</p>

<p>the strip method is part of the family of normalization</p>

<p>gsub = global substitution
sub will only replace the first occurrence it encounters</p>

<p>== is the same as eql method</p>

<p>methods that end with question marks --> the ? is part of the method name that indicates it returns a boolean value</p>

<p>strings like arrays can be sliced</p>

<p>match accepts a pattern of REGEX
  -the string literal for patterns are /a/e/i/o/u
  -check <a href="http://rubluar.com">http://rubluar.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Iteration</strong> is a fancy word for looping</p>

<p>anything that can iterated upon is described as an <em>enumerable</em>
strings and arrays are enumerables</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>

<p>scope gates -- every time you see a 'do', 'end', 'def' keyword your scope changed.</p>

<p>blocks have an exclusive scope. If it is defined in that block and only in that block it is accessible for the outside.
method scopes are even stricter. cannot access method outside of that particular method.
parameters are how you pass in values into a method.</p>

<p>2nd program- (8:25- 8:35)
artist, album, song sorting</p>

<p><em>first step in a program is usually to set up state</em></p>

<p><strong>More Data Types</strong>
<em>Hashes</em> a lot like an array in that it is a collection object. An array is only indexed, so you can only refer to the objects within the array by its position</p>

<p><em>Literal Constructors:</em></p>

<p>"" - strings</p>

<p>/ - REGEX</p>

<p>[] - array</p>

<p>{} - hashes</p>

<p>: - symbols</p>

<p>Hashes are valuable when you care about the meta data</p>

<p>every time you create a new string, it creates a new object in memory
a symbol is an immutable object
``` ruby
vending machine {</p>

<pre><code>a: =&gt; ["snickers", "twix", "kit kat"]
</code></pre>

<p>}
puts vending_machine[:a][0] #=> this accesses the :a key and the 0th position of the array which is the value
```</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Rails Lecture 3- July 15</em></strong></p>

<p>why use 'get' instead of 'match' in the routes file?
-bc want to use http verbs to be more specific
-match is more vague, you should generally use specific verbs</p>

<p><code>
rake routes CONTROLLER=SESSIONS
</code>
will narrow output</p>

<p>```
render :action => 'under_construction' #=> relative to the current controller
render :template => 'shared/under_construction' #=> doesn't assume it is in the current views folder</p>

<h1>under the class name</h1>

<p>render 'shared/under_construction' #=> these 3 work the same now
```</p>

<p><strong>Private Methods</strong>(2:40)
- about what object the receiver is on the method called-- private methods can only be called on implicit receivers
- a way to control scope
- anything that is not an action, that isn't an endpoint of a route should be private</p>

<p>routes: bridge between the browser, specifcially URLs, and the app</p>

<p>Polymorphic Interface(2:50)
The link_to method--> accepts two parameters. the first is the name of the link as a string, the second is the string that it just uses it as a href
-> if I send it an instance of active record, it's behavior will change ==> it will become intelligent and it will understand that it is an instance of active record</p>

<p><strong>Lecture</strong> (2:55)</p>

<p>anything that starts with an underscore '_form.erb.html' for example is a snippet of code that is reused on multiple templates</p>

<p>form_for(@song) --> knows whether the song is new or should be updated... obviously different verbs are required for those diff actions</p>

<p><code>ruby Form Helpers (3:09)
form_for(@song)
f.textfield :artist_name #=&gt; this will break if there is not a artist_name method for the song class in the controller
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby
def create</p>

<pre><code>@song = Song.new(param[:song]) 
# this line instantiates a New Song
# collects the data
#assigning the data to the correct attribute
</code></pre>

<p> #the params[:song] lines does the last two steps
end
```</p>

<p><strong>Params</strong> (3:20)
params looks and behaves like a hash
its a nested hash</p>

<p>``` ruby Assigning a name
@song.name = params[:song][:name] #but this happens during the following line of code:</p>

<p>@song = Song.new(param[:song]) # this happens using mass assignment!
```</p>

<p><code>ruby Manually Assigning the Name
input type ="text" name="song[name]" #this looks like the key of the params hash ==&gt; params[:song][:name]
</code></p>

<p>(3:50) Nested hash testing</p>

<p><code>ruby Query string (3:57)
mldraft.com?person[name]=adam&amp;person[email]=adam@mldraft.com
</code>
Can access the params hash in the same way as the form. So params[:person][:name] will equal adam</p>

<p>Mass Assignment Vulnability (4:05)
- attr_accessible is a whitelist approach versus attr_protected which is a black list approach
- this has nothing to do with the attr_accessor, reader, or writer</p>

<p>Virtual attributes don't persist to the database</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Lecture 2</em></strong></p>

<p>BASH
<code>
cd .. # change to up a directory
cd . # change to current directory
ls # list
cd ~ #home directory
</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong>
- the thing you want to let users manipulate
<code>
rails generate resource Mixtape nae:string
</code></p>

<p>Rake-
a ruby language for running scripts</p>

<p>Models-
main component of your application, they represent the resources of your application
every model is just a ruby class definition located in the model</p>

<p>so the mixtape model defines a class Mixtape that is the object that will allow our app to CRUD mixtapes</p>

<p>If we a Users model we have a users table</p>

<p>Goal for today is to understand the request cycle</p>

<p><strong><em>Routes</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>DSL- Domain Specific Language</em></strong> (3:08PM)
``` ruby
match '/foo' => 'songs#foo' # this needs to be sent to a controller</p>

<h1>a songs controller with the foo action</h1>

<p>```
we need to find something that can handle the route--> we want to send it to a waiter, like ordering an A7 at a chinese resturant</p>

<p><strong>an ACTION is just a method defined in the class!!</strong>
a Controller is just a class --> a grouping that relates to songs</p>

<p>if it can't find a page it is 404</p>

<p>every action in the app needs to be defined</p>

<p>5 keywords available...
MATCH
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE</p>

<p>cmd T --> opens a window for you to access files</p>

<p><strong><em>rake routes:</em></strong>
first column is the request
second is http verb
third is url or pattern
fourth is the contoller#action</p>

<p>resources macro- defines all the restful actions for the resource</p>

<p>?? so what was the main problem with the post request?</p>

<p><strong><em>Controllers &amp; #actions </em></strong></p>

<p>``` ruby e.g. of actions in the Songs controller
def name
  render :template => 'songs/name' #explicit template rendering
end</p>

<h1>exactly the same as this...</h1>

<p>def name
end
```</p>

<p><code>ruby Renders
render :action =&gt; "name" # in the views folder named after the controller
render :template =&gt; 'songs/name' # need to specify the full path
render :xml
render :json
</code></p>

<p>Video 2 starts 4PM
diff between &lt;% and =&lt;%
&lt;% will get executed, but will not show in the html
&lt;%= will get executed and will also show in the html</p>

<p><strong><em> Instance variables </em></strong>
Instance variables are the only thing passed from the controller to the views
??? do class variables get passed as well?</p>

<p><strong>link_to</strong>
<code>ruby
&lt;%= link_to 'Search', 'http://google.com' %&gt;
</code>
we have two methods <em>path and </em>url</p>

<p><code>ruby e.g. of link_to
&lt;%= link_to 'Show', 'song' %&gt; #polymorphic interface
</code></p>

<p>3 pars of rails (4:10 PM)
ORM- active record
Action controller
Action view</p>

<p>LEARN MORE: there are lots of polymorphic interfaces play nicely with active record</p>

<p><code>ruby automatic routing with namespacing with_options
with_options :controller =&gt; 'site' do |s|
  s.get 'about'
  s.get 'home'
end
</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails Lecture I - July 2</p>

<p><strong><em>How the web works:</em></strong>
-the requests we send to other servers have headers with info about the request
-you get the response with a header and the body
-the body is just text and data with HTML
-the communication happens over TCP/IP, namely HTTP
- the browser renders the HTML by making it pretty
-we use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE -</p>

<p>4 imporotant HTTP Verbs-->
GET- retrieve representation of content
POST- Submits data
PUT- Update
Delete- Deletes a specific resource</p>

<p>Convention over configuration
-we wants defaults</p>

<p>There are naming schemes such as:
all tables pl
all models are sigular
controller songs_controller.rb
views songs/</p>

<p><strong><em>Gems:</em></strong>
pre-packaged piece of software that ruby uses</p>

<p>Config Folder--> where the configuration of our app lives
-Database.yaml- this is how we communicate the database</p>

<p>App Folder: spend most of our time in the app directory</p>

<p><strong><em>MVC:</em></strong> (7:42 pm)
Models: define how data is created, retrieved, updated and deleted--> the only code that defined these 4 actions are in the model</p>

<p>Controllers: where to send the data to
business logic</p>

<p>Views: display logic</p>

<p>Helpers: helper functions for your views
db: stores your database and all the instructions for your database</p>

<p>lib: code that you app needs but isn't part of the request cycle
-tasks- background tasks</p>

<p>public dir:
any code that doesn't require the rails stack to run</p>

<p>vendor: any 3rd party library that you didn't write
-- similar to the lib directory that you didn't write</p>

<p><strong><em>REST:</em></strong>
-Representational State Transfer
-URL: unifeied resources locators
- there should be a unified way to expose resources to the world
-1st concept: the things we get online are resources-- what the server is going to respond with is a representation of the real thing (since it can't deliver the real thing)
-there should be consistency and predictability-</p>

<p>rails generate resource song title:string duration:integer #always singular
rails generate scaffold song title:string #in the beginning the first few resources are created by scaffolds</p>

<p><strong><em>MIGRATIONS:</em></strong> defines a db strcuture
every resource has it's own table</p>

<p><strong><em>SQL:</em></strong> server query language or standard query language</p>

<p><strong><em>SCHEMA-</em></strong> describes the structure of the DB</p>

<p><strong><em>RAKE:</em></strong> a ruby library to run background tasks
<code>
rake stats-- gives me stats on the app
rake about--&gt; outputs info about the environment, etc
rake -T --&gt; outputs provides commands
</code></p>

<p>VIDEO 2...</p>

<p>migrations are iterative by nature
every migration should one and only one thing</p>

<p>rake db:migrae runs the migration
rake db:rollback rolls back the migration</p>

<p><strong><em>OBJECT ORIENTATION</em></strong>
-what to create metaphors in our code to representations of the real world
<code>ruby
Song.find(2) #=&gt; finds the object of id 2
Song.all #=&gt; returns all the instances of the class
</code>
<strong><em>ORM: object relational mappers</em></strong>
- a class is to a table : an instance of a class is to a row of a table
-every instance is going to wrap a row of a table
-one to one relationship between an instance and a row
-the library, the ORM, allows you to relate to the objects with knowing how the objects are related</p>

<p>Programming is just codifying procedural knowledge</p>

<p><strong><em>DOCUMENTATION:</em></strong>
Rails Guides: more like how-tos
Rails API: the more technical version</p>
