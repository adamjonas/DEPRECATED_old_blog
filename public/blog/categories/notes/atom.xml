<p>Make sure to modify the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongohq#mongoid">mongoid.yml file</a> to config the production environment.</p>

<p><strong><em>2 major issues with the mongoid deploy:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Issue with ruby version was the first error we encountered... need to keep in that <em>mongoid only supports 1.9.3</em> this ended up being a big issue.</li>
</ol>


<p>In --> heroku logs --tail:
<code>
ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass):
 11:   &lt;/thead&gt;  
 10:     &lt;/tr&gt;
 12:
 13:   &lt;% @airbrake_errors.each_with_index do |a_e, index| %&gt;
</code></p>

<ol>
<li>The other issue was to reconfigure the setting below from false to true as the</li>
</ol>


<p><code>ruby config/environments/production.rb
 config.assets.compile = true
</code></p>

<p>```
 ActionView::Template::Error (images/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png isn't precompiled):</p>

<p> &lt;%= favicon_link_tag 'images/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png', :rel => 'apple-touch-icon-precomposed', :type => 'image/png', :sizes => '144x144' %></p>

<p> app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:19:in `<em>app_views_layouts_application_html_erb</em>__1957659516384225917_21931620'
```</p>

<h3>Rewriting the writer</h3>

<p>```ruby Change the tag writer
def tag_names=(string_of_names)</p>

<pre><code>string_of_names.split(", ").each do |tag_name|
  self.tags.find_or_create_by(name: tag_name)
  #the find_or_create_by wasn't creating unique tag names
  #the reason was because we were linking too many methods together
  #mongoid is finicky
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<h1>was changed to...</h1>

<p>def tag_names=(string_of_names)</p>

<pre><code>self.tags &lt;&lt; string_of_names.split(", ").collect do |tag_name|
  tag = Tag.find_or_create_by(name: tag_name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<h1>but we discoved that the tags were no disappearing if they were left off the form</h1>

<p>def tag_names=(string_of_names)
   #later we added this line because tags were persisting even if we tried to edit them.</p>

<pre><code>self.tags.delete_all
self.tags &lt;&lt; string_of_names.split(", ").collect do |tag_name|
  tag = Tag.find_or_create_by(name: tag_name)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
<code>
</code>ruby the last td was changed...
 &lt;% @airbrake_errors.each_with_index do |a_e, index| %></p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;%= a_e.tags.collect{ |tag|
        link_to(tag.name, tag_path(tag)) #=&gt; "&lt;a href="adasda"&gt;Tag&lt;/a&gt;"
    }.join(", ").html_safe %&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    # this needs to be better understood-- TODO
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pivotal:
Move from icebox to current
Click Start
Each story is either a feature, a bug, or a chore</p>

<p>Generate our app
Some sort of layout
beginning data model
- main model
- tag model
Import script to retreive that data off the API</p>

<p>Views/Controllers
- index view
- tagging</p>

<p>Keep commits small and never develop in the master branch</p>

<p>Git:
Git create the repo
git clone the repo
git merge mongoid-setup --no-ff #no FF- will show the branch even after the commmit</p>

<p>Mongoid-
rails new myapp -O (--skip-active-record)
<code>
gem 'mongoid', "~&gt; 3.0.0"
</code></p>

<p>Twitter Bootstrap
gem twitter-bootstrap</p>

<p>Airbrake Gem</p>

<p>Powder Gem
gem install powder
makes app available at airbrake.dev</p>

<p>Immediately want to start creating the 'error model', but error is a terrible title so call it airbrake model</p>

<p>Routes:
change index to errors#index</p>

<p>Generate airbrake_errors model
Generate errors_controller
Generate bootstrap
<code>ruby Fluid Layout
rails g bootstrap layout application fluid
</code>
<code>ruby In Console
AirbrakeError.create(:name =&gt; "Test")
</code></p>

<p>in the test unit, want to check that AirbrakeError.delete_all
test to make sure the airbrake API gem tried to connect</p>

<p><code>ruby
def AirbrakeError.import_from_airbrake
</code></p>

<p>Create initializer to config the connection to airbrake</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>build out the bootstrap layout
build the import script</p>

<p>Ruby Debugger: TODO
gem debugger at the bottom of the gem file
bundle</p>

<p>inspect the hashiemashie to see how the objects are composed</p>

<p><code>ruby
def self.import_from_airbrake
  a = AirbrakeAPI::Client.new
end
</code></p>

<p>Airbrake Doc:
Can make calls to get a list of errors in general and a call to get more info about an error.
-The api in general isn't all that detailed.</p>

<p>There is a diff between .error('id') and .errors -- the difference is in what is returned-- i.e. the backtrace etc.</p>

<p>check out what notices because we are probably interested more in the notice than the error itself.</p>

<p><code>ruby Maybe Something Like This?
def ignore
  AirbrakeAPI.update(self.id, :group =&gt; { :resolved =&gt; true})
end
</code></p>

<p>Diff between error and notice: an error is a unique conceptual item and a notice is the occurance of the error</p>

<p>```ruby
h = {:a => 1}
  h.each do |k,v|
  end
b[k] = v</p>

<h1>this is the same as the dynamic dispatching method</h1>

<p>airbrake.send("#{key}=", value)
```</p>

<p>From there let's go to the view and start formatting the output</p>

<p>Ruby alias method-- this is built into ruby not rails or mongoid
<code>ruby airbrake_error.rb
alias :name :error_message
</code></p>

<p>TIPS and Tricks section:
Gem Server shows the documentation locally</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a></p>

<p>LOOK-UP 'Client', 'tap', 'send'
dynamic dispatch and the send method
rails cycle
Moped::BSON: -- how it generates its unique IDs</p>

<p>GIT STUFF:
<code>
git pull --rebase #=&gt; if the remote has merges, rewind and then move back forward
git reset --hard HEAD #=&gt; go to the last checkout (HEAD of the branch) without the warnings (hard)
git stash # save changes
git stash pop #restore changes
</code></p>

<p><code>
♕ git add .
♕ git status
♕ git checkout -b link-to-airbrake
M   app/models/airbrake_error.rb
M   app/views/errors/index.html.erb
Switched to a new branch 'link-to-airbrake'
♕ git add .
♕ git commit -am "added airbrake_url method and link_to in views"

    <updated>2012-07-16T16:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/07/16/lecture-3-july-15</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Rails Lecture 3- July 15</em></strong></p>

<p>why use 'get' instead of 'match' in the routes file?
-bc want to use http verbs to be more specific
-match is more vague, you should generally use specific verbs</p>

<p><code>
rake routes CONTROLLER=SESSIONS
</code>
will narrow output</p>

<p>```
render :action => 'under_construction' #=> relative to the current controller
render :template => 'shared/under_construction' #=> doesn't assume it is in the current views folder</p>

<h1>under the class name</h1>

<p>render 'shared/under_construction' #=> these 3 work the same now
```</p>

<p><strong>Private Methods</strong>(2:40)
- about what object the receiver is on the method called-- private methods can only be called on implicit receivers
- a way to control scope
- anything that is not an action, that isn't an endpoint of a route should be private</p>

<p>routes: bridge between the browser, specifcially URLs, and the app</p>

<p>Polymorphic Interface(2:50)
The link_to method--> accepts two parameters. the first is the name of the link as a string, the second is the string that it just uses it as a href
-> if I send it an instance of active record, it's behavior will change ==> it will become intelligent and it will understand that it is an instance of active record</p>

<p><strong>Lecture</strong> (2:55)</p>

<p>anything that starts with an underscore '_form.erb.html' for example is a snippet of code that is reused on multiple templates</p>

<p>form_for(@song) --> knows whether the song is new or should be updated... obviously different verbs are required for those diff actions</p>

<p><code>ruby Form Helpers (3:09)
form_for(@song)
f.textfield :artist_name #=&gt; this will break if there is not a artist_name method for the song class in the controller
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby
def create</p>

<pre><code>@song = Song.new(param[:song]) 
# this line instantiates a New Song
# collects the data
#assigning the data to the correct attribute
</code></pre>

<p> #the params[:song] lines does the last two steps
end
```</p>

<p><strong>Params</strong> (3:20)
params looks and behaves like a hash
its a nested hash</p>

<p>``` ruby Assigning a name
@song.name = params[:song][:name] #but this happens during the following line of code:</p>

<p>@song = Song.new(param[:song]) # this happens using mass assignment!
```</p>

<p><code>ruby Manually Assigning the Name
input type ="text" name="song[name]" #this looks like the key of the params hash ==&gt; params[:song][:name]
</code></p>

<p>(3:50) Nested hash testing</p>

<p><code>ruby Query string (3:57)
mldraft.com?person[name]=adam&amp;person[email]=adam@mldraft.com
</code>
Can access the params hash in the same way as the form. So params[:person][:name] will equal adam</p>

<p>Mass Assignment Vulnability (4:05)
- attr_accessible is a whitelist approach versus attr_protected which is a black list approach
- this has nothing to do with the attr_accessor, reader, or writer</p>

<p>Virtual attributes don't persist to the database</p>

<p>BASH
<code>
cd .. # change to up a directory
cd . # change to current directory
ls # list
cd ~ #home directory
</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong>
- the thing you want to let users manipulate
<code>
rails generate resource Mixtape nae:string
</code></p>

<p>Rake-
a ruby language for running scripts</p>

<p>Models-
main component of your application, they represent the resources of your application
every model is just a ruby class definition located in the model</p>

<p>so the mixtape model defines a class Mixtape that is the object that will allow our app to CRUD mixtapes</p>

<p>If we a Users model we have a users table</p>

<p>Goal for today is to understand the request cycle</p>

<p><strong><em>Routes</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>DSL- Domain Specific Language</em></strong> (3:08PM)
``` ruby
match '/foo' => 'songs#foo' # this needs to be sent to a controller</p>

<h1>a songs controller with the foo action</h1>

<p>```
we need to find something that can handle the route--> we want to send it to a waiter, like ordering an A7 at a chinese resturant</p>

<p><strong>an ACTION is just a method defined in the class!!</strong>
a Controller is just a class --> a grouping that relates to songs</p>

<p>if it can't find a page it is 404</p>

<p>every action in the app needs to be defined</p>

<p>5 keywords available...
MATCH
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE</p>

<p>cmd T --> opens a window for you to access files</p>

<p><strong><em>rake routes:</em></strong>
first column is the request
second is http verb
third is url or pattern
fourth is the contoller#action</p>

<p>resources macro- defines all the restful actions for the resource</p>

<p>?? so what was the main problem with the post request?</p>

<p><strong><em>Controllers &amp; #actions </em></strong></p>

<p>``` ruby e.g. of actions in the Songs controller
def name
  render :template => 'songs/name' #explicit template rendering
end</p>

<h1>exactly the same as this...</h1>

<p>def name
end
```</p>

<p><code>ruby Renders
render :action =&gt; "name" # in the views folder named after the controller
render :template =&gt; 'songs/name' # need to specify the full path
render :xml
render :json
</code></p>

<p>Video 2 starts 4PM
diff between &lt;% and =&lt;%
&lt;% will get executed, but will not show in the html
&lt;%= will get executed and will also show in the html</p>

<p><strong><em> Instance variables </em></strong>
Instance variables are the only thing passed from the controller to the views
??? do class variables get passed as well?</p>

<p><strong>link_to</strong>
<code>ruby
&lt;%= link_to 'Search', 'http://google.com' %&gt;
</code>
we have two methods <em>path and </em>url</p>

<p><code>ruby e.g. of link_to
&lt;%= link_to 'Show', 'song' %&gt; #polymorphic interface
</code></p>

<p>3 pars of rails (4:10 PM)
ORM- active record
Action controller
Action view</p>

<p>LEARN MORE: there are lots of polymorphic interfaces play nicely with active record</p>

<p><code>ruby automatic routing with namespacing with_options
with_options :controller =&gt; 'site' do |s|
  s.get 'about'
  s.get 'home'
end

    <updated>2012-07-03T10:53:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/07/03/procs-and-lambdas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know how everything in Ruby is an object, well, as it turns out that's not quite true. Ruby blocks are not objects! So, blocks are not objects, but you can turn them into objects without too much trouble. We do this by wrapping our block in an instance of the Proc class...
PROCS:</p>

<p>Very standard to pass along a code block to the each method</p>

<p>block_given? --> method to check whether a block was given to a method or not</p>

<p>A proc --> a nameless or anonymous block of code that can be represented as an object, can be passed around and called at will</p>

<p>``` ruby E.G.
class Array
def random_each(&amp;b)  # => with the ampersand, b essentially becomes a reference to the code block below.
  shuffle.each do |el|</p>

<pre><code>b.call el  #=&gt; b is a proc
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>[1,2,3,4,5].random_each do |el|
puts |el|</p>

<p>end
```
You can only pass a single block to a method at one time, but you can pass multiple procs around because they are regular object like arrays or strings.</p>

<p>``` ruby E.G.
Def run_two_procs (a, b)
  a.call
  b.call
end</p>

<p>proc1 = Proc.new do
puts "This is proc1"
end</p>

<p>proc2 = Proc.new do
puts "This is proc2"
end</p>

<p>run_two_procs proc1, proc2
```
If you have a code block, you can call it with yield, you can use the ampersand argument to convert it into a proc,</p>

<p>**if you use Proc.new without giving it a code block to assign to that Proc, Proc.new will look to see if the current scope has been passed a code block and then it will use that --> it will do it all implicitly, you don't need to specify anything here. If it can't find a block (e..g if you commented the block below) it raises an error. Proc.new wants a block passed directly or it implicitly picks it up from the current scope/environment.</p>

<p>``` ruby
Def run_block
  p = Proc.new # **see above
  p.call
end</p>

<p>run_block do
puts "Hello World'</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9 there are 4 main ways to run or call a block:
``` ruby Proc e.g.
my_proc = Proc.new do |a|
  puts "This is a proc and #{a} was passed along to me"
my_proc.call(10) #call method that passes in 10
my_proc.(20) #this isn't a typo, gets converted to a call
my_proc[30] #
my_proc === 40 # triple equal is called the case equality operator, it's primary function is used in case statements</p>

<p>several = Proc.new { |number| number > 3 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 8 }
none = Proc.new { |number| number == 0 }</p>

<p>case number
when several
  puts "several"
when none
  puts "none"
end
```
-->In this case the several proc is being run and if it returns true it runs the puts --> this abstracts everything away</p>

<p><strong><em>Lambdas</em></strong></p>

<p>Lambdas are much more sensitive than Procs to parameters. Much like methods, they need to receive the exact number of arguments as defined. Procs will just grab nil if nothing has been passed in.
Closures</p>

<p>In ruby a closure is like an anonymous code block, but that maintains references to local variables and were being used at the time of the definition of that code.
``` ruby
def run_proc(p)
  p.call
end</p>

<p>name = "Fred"</p>

<p>print_a_name = proc { puts name } # this name doesn't exist in the definition above. This magic is called a closure. (23 Min)</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name
```</p>

<p>ALSO:
``` ruby
def run_proc(p)
  p.call
end</p>

<p>name = "Fred"
print_a_name = proc { puts name }
name = "John"</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name # => now this will output John because it kept a reference to the local variable.
```
