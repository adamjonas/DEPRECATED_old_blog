    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So accepts nested attributes is really about writing to an attribute of a class.</p>

<p>In my case a location belongs_to a user. I was then trying to set the location.street1 through the user, but it wouldn't write. This is because it needs the accepts_nested_attributes method in the model.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>POTD</h3>

<p>Linus Torvalds</p>

<h2>Rails</h2>

<p>rails assigns attr_accessors</p>

<p><code>ruby Active Record Queries
song.limit(2).last #=&gt; this is the second to last song
Song.find(1)
Song.find_by_name
Song.find_by_anyattrributename
Song.find_all_by_name #=&gt; sweet
</code></p>

<h3>ORM ~> Object Relational Mapping</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>A ruby class is to a databse table as instances of that class are to a row in that table</strong>

<ul>
<li>the form field should map to the column name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>activerecord's exists to accomplish CRUD</li>
<li>active record pattern <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture%20by%20Martin%20Fowler&amp;pg=PT187#v=onepage&amp;q=active%20record&amp;f=false">proposed by Martin Fowler</a></li>
</ul>


<p><code>ruby Persistence
new_song = Song.new
new_song.persisted? #=&gt; false
new_song.new_record? #=&gt; true
new_song.save
new_song.persisted? #=&gt; true
new_song.new_record? #=&gt; false
</code>
<code>ruby ORM Awareness
new_song.name = "new"
s.changed? #=&gt; true
s.changes #=&gt; {"name=&gt; ["whatever", "new"]}
s.name_changed? #=&gt; true
s.duration_changed #=&gt; false
</code>
<code>ruby
song.destroy #=&gt; will destroy the record
song.delete #=&gt; don't use this for now
</code></p>

<h3>REST</h3>

<p>Identification of a resource
Individual resources that are identified in the requests, for example using the URIs sin web-based REST systems.</p>

<p>REST- the url address should mirror the http verb and url action</p>

<ul>
<li><em>What do you mean by a representation?</em></li>
<li>these objects have different representations depending on their name</li>
<li>.xml should return the xml and .json and return the json</li>
<li>the objects should be devoid of your form until you ask for them</li>
</ul>


<h3>Routes</h3>

<p>```ruby Routes File syntax
get '/welcome' => 'application#welcome'</p>

<h1>same as ApplcationController.welcome</h1>

<p>=> {controller => 'application', :action => 'welcome'}
resources :songs #is a macro that is calling 7 methods for you
```</p>

<ul>
<li>the routes file are evaluated with lazy evaluation. Which allows you to put the most specific patterns on top and let them trickle down...</li>
<li>7 restful routes: get, create, update, delete, show, etc.</li>
<li><p><em>url endpoint</em>- the very last thing that is executed after a url request- the last application run is the action in the controller</p></li>
<li><p><strong>URL request cascade through a rails app:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>web server gets request</li>
<li>send it through the rack</li>
<li>last stop, routes file</li>
<li>match a  route</li>
<li>request = SongContoller.new</li>
<li>response = request.index</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Rails was the first to have implicit rendering...
```ruby Implicit Rendering
def index
  @index = Song.all
end</p>

<h1>this will implicitly render the index page</h1>

<h1>could also add ~> render 'artist/index' &lt;~ which will over-write the implicitly render</h1>

<h1>'artist/index' is a method called on self</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>class variable can inherit down the inheritance tree
a class instance var is private to the class</p>

<p>```ruby
def initialize</p>

<pre><code>@songs = []
@genres = []
Artist.all &lt;&lt; self??
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>VPS- Virtual Private server</p>

<p>Linux distribution - ubuntu
server - nginx
unicorn
DB- postgres</p>

<h3>Visualization</h3>

<ul>
<li>how does a partition actually work?

<ul>
<li>2 cores or 4 cores?? i don't know what a core is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hardware usually out-paces software

<ul>
<li>we have had <em>multi-core processors</em> before we had software to take advantage of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>vocab:</p>

<ul>
<li>slice, a box, a vps, are pretty much synonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>dediserve is the server we are using</p></li>
<li>RAM has fast access.</li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/15882917">capistrano</a></li>
</ul>


<p>```
ssh root@96.8ipaddress</p>

<h1>will get an error saying that you can't connect</h1>

<h1>say yes</h1>

<h1>next insert your password:</h1>

<h1>create a new user instead of root</h1>

<p>useradd #to get access to instructons
man useradd
useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo ajonas</p>

<h1>sudo says anyone in sudo group can use sudo adam</h1>

<h1>userdel will delete a user</h1>

<p>passwd ajonas</p>

<h1>enter password:</h1>

<p>ssh root@96.8ipaddress will get you in</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update #for updating indexes and downloading packages, like homebrew
sudo apt-get upgrade
build-apt-install build-essential</p>

<h1>install your packages with apt-get</h1>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Capistrano</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>handles your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_management">release management</a> throw the entire code base on your server every time you deploy. Copy code off of Github or server and apply it. This will maintain revisions, roll back easily, compile the CSS in your assets. It can't happen manually.
<code>
cap deploy
</code>
will do this for you. It's script-able and automatic.</p></li>
<li><p>This is run locally.</p></li>
<li>cap is what you use to interact with capistrano from the outside (like rails new from outside a rails project)</li>
<li>capify is how you interact with the gem (like rails generate inside the project folder)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Web Servers</h3>

<ul>
<li>apache was the market leader for best of breed of web server</li>
<li><p>ngenx - can handle lots of requests and tries to stay really small</p>

<ul>
<li>has much smaller memory footprint</li>
<li>has some features that are better suited for rails</li>
<li>ngenx is also a really good load balancer</li>
<li>config file is much easier to understand than ngenx</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Four functions in the config/deploy.rb DSL</p>

<ul>
<li>set: capistrano variables</li>
<li>role:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Further reading</h3>

<ul>
<li>backups</li>
<li>log rotations - when your log gets too big, it is going to zip it up and send it to some long term storage. The first thing hackers will do is go through the logs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Reading in prep:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Capistrano reads its instructions from a capfile.</li>
<li>many server clusters are hidden behind NATs (Network address translation) and firewalls, to prevent direct access.

<ul>
<li>NATs - the process of modifying IP address information in IP packet headers while in transit across a traffic routing device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tasks are the foundation of a Capistrano setup; collections of tasks are typically called Recipes.</li>
<li><p>Daemons are special system applications which typically execute continuously in the background and await requests for the functions they provide from other applications.</p></li>
<li><p><em>From lowest to highest, the layers of the internet protocol suite are:</em></p></li>
<li>The link layer (commonly Ethernet) contains communication technologies for a local network.</li>
<li>The internet layer (IP) connects local networks, thus establishing internetworking.</li>
<li>The transport layer (TCP) handles host-to-host communication.</li>
<li><p>The application layer (for example HTTP) contains all protocols for specific data communications services on a process-to-process level (for example how a web browser communicates with a web server).</p></li>
<li><p>Stateless firewalls require less memory, and can be faster for simple filters that require less time to filter than to look up a session.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern firewalls can filter traffic based on many packet attributes like source IP address, source port, destination IP address or port, destination service like WWW or FTP.</p></li>
</ul>

    <updated>2012-07-29T14:20:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/07/29/lecture-7-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>``` ruby Song class
def genre_name
  self.genres.collect{|g| g.name.join(",")}
end</p>

<p>def genre_name=(str)
  str.split(",").collect{|s| s.downcase.strip}.</p>

<pre><code>SongGenre.new(:genre =&gt; Genre.find_or_create_by_name(genre_name))
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>an album has many songs... which means the accepts nested attributes for will be a good fit</p>

<h3>Nested Resource</h3>

<p>begins with the routes</p>

<p><a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-part-1">Nested Model Form Rails Cast</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.aviflombaum.com/blog/2012/07/dont-use-accepts-nested-attributes-for-with-belongs-to/"><strong><em>Dont' use nested attributes for a belongs_to association</em></strong></a></p>

<p>mass assignment and the .build(params[:user_name])</p>

<p>Form_for (2:40)</p>

<h3>Layouts and Sub-layouts</h3>

<p><code>ruby On the Index Page
&lt;% content_for :sub_nav do %&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to "New Song", new_song_path %&gt;
 &lt;% end %&gt;
 # this could also be on the show page so they would share this sub_nav
 &lt;nav class="sub_nav"&gt;
  &lt;%= yield :sub_nav %&gt;
 &lt;% end %&gt;
 # this works because you create another yield in the app besides the body
</code>
you can open up a sublayout as many times as you want to add links...</p>

<p><a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to_unless_current">link_to_unless_current</a>- it just creates the title, not the link to its own page... useful for nav bars</p>

<p>polymorphic interfaces: depending on the argument that you send it, it has different behavior
when you send @mixtape it looks up:
<code>ruby
mixtape_path(@mixtape) #=&gt; '/mixtapes/1'
</code>
real life e.g.s
subway slot can accept a metrocard and a credit card-- depending on what you send it, it has differnt behavior
a vending machine accepts dollar bills and credit card. Depending on what you insert, it has different behavior.</p>

<p>render is another flexible polymorphic object-
``` ruby Rending Partials in a Collection- very important
&lt;%= render @mixtape.songs %></p>

<h1>Down a level of abstraction since it reveals the collection and partial:</h1>

<p>&lt;%= render :collection => @mixtape.songs, :partial => songs/song_li', :as => :song %>
```</p>

<p><code>ruby Cast Variables
&lt;%= render 'songs/fields', :f =&gt; song_form %&gt;
</code>
If skip album name is true, then
(3:40)
``` ruby
&lt;% if include_album_name %>
  <div class="field"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% f.label :album %&gt; &lt;br /&gt;#more code....
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#asset-tag-helpers">Passing Local Variables into Partials</a>... need to scroll down a little</p>

<p>write_attribute</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davidverhasselt.com/2011/06/28/5-ways-to-set-attributes-in-activerecord/">5 ways to set attributes in ActiveRecord</a></p>

<p>Could use callbacks and lifecycle hooks to normalize as well...
```ruby
before_validate :normalize_name</p>

<p>def normalize_name
  self.name = self.name.downcase.strip
end
```</p>

    <link href="http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/07/23/lecture-6-rails/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-23T19:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/07/23/lecture-6-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>if it has a belongs_to it has a foreign key...
e.g. songs belong to an artist, so it must have an artist_id</p>

<p>``` ruby</p>

<h1>the return value of this is all the songs</h1>

<p>aretha.song &lt;&lt; Song.new(:name => "Natural Woman")</p>

<h1>this is just one song</h1>

<p>respect = aretha.songs.build(:name => "Respect")
```</p>

<p>7:27
``` ruby
favorites.mixtape_songs.build :song => Song.find_by_name("Thriller")</p>

<h1>these accomplish the same thing, but above is more expressive</h1>

<p>favorites.songs &lt;&lt; Song.first
```</p>

<p>the first level of keys in the params hash is usually scope.</p>

<p>what is params?
- user passes in data through forms
- rails takes that data and makes it easy to access through forms</p>

<p>so <em>accepts_nested_attributes</em> is a way for you to specify that this model should accept data for its associations</p>

<p>field_for
f.fields_for :song_genres
is accessing params[:song][:song_genres]</p>

<h3>Select Boxes</h3>

<p>select(method, choices, options = {}, html_options = {})
<code>ruby
&lt;%= song_genre.select :genre_id, [
  ["Rap", 1]
  ["Pop", 2]
  ["Whatever", 3]
  ] %&gt;
</code>
<strong>Text Boxes</strong>:
adding functionalty</p>

<p><strong><em>classes are data and behavior</em></strong>
we have added behavior to the song_genre model because this is the only place the genre_id is being stored.</p>

<p><em>LookUp</em> Ruby try method</p>

<p>``` ruby Delegate
delegate :name, :to => :genre, :prefix => true, :allow_nils => true</p>

<h1>the above macro is the same as the method below method.</h1>

<p>def genre_name
  genre.name if genre
end
```</p>

<h3>Normalization</h3>

<p>the incision point for normalization are easy to do on writer. but if you are using a vanilla writer, then don't write a normalizer just to normalize. Use a gem or something.</p>

<p><code>
:uniq
If true, duplicates will be omitted from the collection. Useful in conjunction with :through.
</code>
in general this goes on the through model... which doesn't make all that much sense, but that's how it goes on many to many relationships
This isn't preventing the creation of duplicates, it's just treating duplicates as singular-- total crap</p>

<p>8:15
Allow destroy
with a checkbox</p>

<h3>Validations</h3>

<p>```</p>

<h1>following valdiation rule is a constraint on the following attribute</h1>

<p>validates :name, :length => {:minimum => 2, :maximum => 12}
validates :name, :uniqueness => { :scope => :song_id}
```
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html">See rails guides validations</a>
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html#uniqueness">specifically uniqueness</a></p>

<h3>Technical Debt</h3>

<p>Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is a neologistic metaphor referring to the eventual consequences of poor or evolving software architecture and software development within a codebase. The debt can be thought of as work that needs to be done before a particular job can be considered complete.</p>

<p>in console can call .valid? to debug and see if an object is valid.</p>

<h3>When debugging...</h3>

<p>try to reduce abstraction
-actually need to debug the problem at hand</p>
