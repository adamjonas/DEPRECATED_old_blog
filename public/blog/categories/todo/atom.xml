    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know how everything in Ruby is an object, well, as it turns out that's not quite true. Ruby blocks are not objects! So, blocks are not objects, but you can turn them into objects without too much trouble. We do this by wrapping our block in an instance of the Proc class...
PROCS:</p>

<p>Very standard to pass along a code block to the each method</p>

<p>block_given? --> method to check whether a block was given to a method or not</p>

<p>A proc --> a nameless or anonymous block of code that can be represented as an object, can be passed around and called at will</p>

<p>``` ruby E.G.
class Array
def random_each(&amp;b)  # => with the ampersand, b essentially becomes a reference to the code block below.
  shuffle.each do |el|</p>

<pre><code>b.call el  #=&gt; b is a proc
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>[1,2,3,4,5].random_each do |el|
puts |el|</p>

<p>end
```
You can only pass a single block to a method at one time, but you can pass multiple procs around because they are regular object like arrays or strings.</p>

<p>``` ruby E.G.
Def run_two_procs (a, b)
  a.call
  b.call
end</p>

<p>proc1 = Proc.new do
puts "This is proc1"
end</p>

<p>proc2 = Proc.new do
puts "This is proc2"
end</p>

<p>run_two_procs proc1, proc2
```
If you have a code block, you can call it with yield, you can use the ampersand argument to convert it into a proc,</p>

<p>**if you use Proc.new without giving it a code block to assign to that Proc, Proc.new will look to see if the current scope has been passed a code block and then it will use that --> it will do it all implicitly, you don't need to specify anything here. If it can't find a block (e..g if you commented the block below) it raises an error. Proc.new wants a block passed directly or it implicitly picks it up from the current scope/environment.</p>

<p>``` ruby
Def run_block
  p = Proc.new # **see above
  p.call
end</p>

<p>run_block do
puts "Hello World'</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9 there are 4 main ways to run or call a block:
``` ruby Proc e.g.
my_proc = Proc.new do |a|
  puts "This is a proc and #{a} was passed along to me"
my_proc.call(10) #call method that passes in 10
my_proc.(20) #this isn't a typo, gets converted to a call
my_proc[30] #
my_proc === 40 # triple equal is called the case equality operator, it's primary function is used in case statements</p>

<p>several = Proc.new { |number| number > 3 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 8 }
none = Proc.new { |number| number == 0 }</p>

<p>case number
when several
  puts "several"
when none
  puts "none"
end
```
-->In this case the several proc is being run and if it returns true it runs the puts --> this abstracts everything away</p>

<p><strong><em>Lambdas</em></strong></p>

<p>Lambdas are much more sensitive than Procs to parameters. Much like methods, they need to receive the exact number of arguments as defined. Procs will just grab nil if nothing has been passed in.
Closures</p>

<p>In ruby a closure is like an anonymous code block, but that maintains references to local variables and were being used at the time of the definition of that code.
``` ruby
def run_proc(p)
  p.call
end</p>

<p>name = "Fred"</p>

<p>print_a_name = proc { puts name } # this name doesn't exist in the definition above. This magic is called a closure. (23 Min)</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name
```</p>

<p>ALSO:
``` ruby
def run_proc(p)
  p.call
end</p>

<p>name = "Fred"
print_a_name = proc { puts name }
name = "John"</p>

<p>run_proc print_a_name # => now this will output John because it kept a reference to the local variable.
```

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't found great explanations for this yet but there is a video below... prety much the tap method allows you to initialize methods right off the bat.</p>

<p>The tap method is available to all Ruby objects and serves as a way to have a block "act on" the method's caller and return the object called. Per the Ruby docs, "the primary purpose of this method is to 'tap into' a method chain, in order to perform operations on intermediate results within the chain". For some examples on using tap see MenTaLguY's post on Eavesdropping on Expressions. As he says in his post, "you can insert your code just about anywhere without disturbing the flow of data."</p>

<p>I'm having some trouble following all this... Matt Stopa has a video below that is more for a beginner.</p>
