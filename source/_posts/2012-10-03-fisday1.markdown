Lessons learned from day0 project

- Positives:  worked well in a group, made sure that everyone got there page done.
- Mistakes: could have walked around and see what other teams were doing, could have focused more on layout/style and then breakout overnight to write the content.

shell
: guis are an illusion. They are a visualizations of the shell. 
	: BASH- invented by [Stephen Bourne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne)
	: ZSH- alternative shell that isn't standard

BASH
: Bourne Again Shell

[surfraw](http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/)

[POSIX system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) based off of BASH

dot files are hidden files

bash profile runs everytime I open up a new file

pwd will output the full path
~ => home directory

BASHrc(runs second) and BASHLogin(runs first) 


*BIN*

- create a path that says these files and directories can be considered local at all times-- make them local at all times.
- all binaries programs which are executables are in the bin dir	

*RVM*

- if you find yourself in the wrong version of ruby it must have been because the path was messed up

ps - shows what is available 
ps aux - shows all the programs that are running at all times
```
kill 81367 #=> kills the task with the id x
ps aux | grep sub #=> this takes the output of ps aux and output it to the other side of the pipe
```

ssh keys- private/public key encryption key. Can't decrypt a message with my private key, but not my public key.
encryption is with the public and
decryption is the private

Brew:
package manager for open source software
```
brew doctor

[IRBRC](http://drnicwilliams.com/2006/10/12/my-irbrc-for-consoleirb/) - runs everytime I open IRB
gcc - C compiler
need a visualizer

solarized
prgrammer fonts

*symbolic link*
usr/local/bin is where we put all of our binaries

ln -s "link the stuff from here to..." 'also look here'


ls -lah

*RVM*
If the wrong version is being used
```
rvm use 1.9.3 --default
```

*.irbrc file*

- local_method is added here
```ruby
class Object
  def local_methods
    (methods - Object.instance_methods).sort
  end
end
```

*Git*

- [.gitignore file](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files)

*Bash*

- .bash_profile > .bash_login > .profile
- .bash_logout would run when you log out
- .bashrc - always get loaded afterwards through the source command

subshell is a non-login shell
.bashrc runs every time you pull up a non-login terminal

*SublimeText2*
[Package installer](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) allows you to install packages for sublime using cmd+shift+p
