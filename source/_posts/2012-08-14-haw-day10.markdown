###Code Clean Up
if they are submitting tag_names (a comma seperated list of tag values) pass that data to tag_names=
but if they are submitting a single tag_name, such as slug pass that to a different method...

```ruby Structure
params[:airbrake_error][:tag_slug] = params[:tag_slug]
{:airbrake_error => {:tag_slug => "Signal"}, :tag_slug => "Signal"}
```
