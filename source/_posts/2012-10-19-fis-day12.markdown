###POTD: Tim Berners-Lee###
- physicist 
- invented the world wide web in 1989 @ [Cern](http://public.web.cern.ch/public/)
- [Marshall_McLuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan)


###Modules###
**Dogs and humans can both run, so should they inherit from runner or runnable?**

We put this shared behavior into a module so that the class can include or **mixin** modules.

modules can include other modules

include - is for the instance methods
extend - is for the class methods

super - call the same exact message on the class above

```ruby Simple Inheritance
class Animal
 attr_accessor :legs

 def initialize(legs_count = 4)
 	@leg = legs_count
 end
end

class Human < Animal
  attr_accessor :hair_color #this is an additional accessor
  #and doesn't over-ride any #other attr_accessor

#this overides the initialize in the Animal class
	def initialize
		super(2) #super sexy
	end

end
```

```ruby The Builder Pattern
class Animal
	include Movement::Animal
end

class Human
	include Movement::Animal
	include Movement::Human
end
```

**A class is a module (that can be instantiated).**

###ERB###
The [standard library](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/) is separate because you can release ruby and the standard lib without updating the release of the other

<%=  %> (known as a delimiter) is like interpolation for a template

```ruby
require 'erb'

x = 42
#EOF = end of file
template = ERB.new <<-EOF
	the value of x is: <%= x %>
EOF

puts template.result(binding) #the value of x is :42

x = 24
puts template.result(binding) #the value of x is: 24
```

binding - is equal to the current scope - return to me everything in the universe that happened at this point in time.
