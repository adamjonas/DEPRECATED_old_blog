  - Dan Benjamin
  - Jason Santa Maria
  - Simplebits.com

###Gitbo
  - Popularity index
  - [sidekiq](http://railscasts.com/episodes/366-sidekiq)
  - nested issues in repos
  - slugs wiht friendly_id

###Rails Lecture
 - sub-yields or sub-layouts

```ruby
#in layouts/application.html.erb
<% content_for :page-navigation %>

#at the top of the pages that need it
<%= yield :page-navigation %>
```

  - Applicaiton level layout
  - controller level layout
  - action level layout

```ruby  Action Level Layout
respond_to do |format|
  format.html {render :layout => 'application'}
```

- content for will allow you to append to the outter layer

###Application.css
- The manifest file
  - require tree . -> require all files at the same level of this file (dot means current dir, .. means dir above)
  - [sprocket directives](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/blob/master/lib/sprockets/directive_processor.rb) tells the app what to include and maintain
  - files are loaded in order
  - in production, all the assets will be packed

###Compiling
- rake assets:precompile

- rails s --environment=production
  - shortcut
    - rails s -e production

###Pre-processors
- css: doesn't allow css variables
  - [scss and sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
    - scss is backwards compatible with css
  - sass adds lots of css like variables
- coffeescript 
  - makes the syntax nicer than javascript
  - not backwards compatible with javascript
- less
  - dynamic stylesheet
- HAML
  - HMTL preprocessor

###locales/application.rb
  - want to be sure that all finger prints are new -> config.assets.version = '1.1'
  - config.assets.compile = false /true -> will precompile assets on the first request

###Pictures in asset pipeline
  - Need image-url to trigger the asset pipeline

```
h1.logo{
  url: image-url('/whatever.png');
}
#NOT
h1.logo{
  url: url('/assets/whatever.png');
}
```
In order to use image-url, it needs to be a scss file

###Managing Version Asset files
  - can manage versions with bundler
  - declare jquery rails engine means that the app's asset path will be loaded autmatically
    - jquery-rails has a vendor dir, so that it adds it when I compile by vendor dir
  
###Bootstrap
  - rails generate bookstrap:install
  - tell manifest file to actually include the js
  - in app.css 
    - require bootstrap_and_overides
  - rails g bootstrap:layouts

  - <http://wrapbootstrap.com>
  - <http://bootsnipp.com/>
  - <http://dresssed.com/>
