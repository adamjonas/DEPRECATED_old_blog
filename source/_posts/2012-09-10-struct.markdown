```ruby Struct
Struct.new("Flatiron", :name, :location)

flatiron = Struct::Flatiron.new
flatiron.name "Flatiron"
flatiron.location = "33 West 26th st"
```

```ruby Here is another way to do it...
School = Struct.new(:name, :location)
flatiron = School.new("flatiron", "33 west 26th")
```
```ruby we can also define a method in the struct
School = Struct.new(:name, :location)
	def travel
		puts "going to #{location} location..."
	end
end

flatiron = School.new("flatiron", "33 west 26th")

flatiron.travel
```
