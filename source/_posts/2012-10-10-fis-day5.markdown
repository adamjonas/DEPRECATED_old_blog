"Classes are state plus behavior, if you just want the behavior then use a module!"

```ruby This is no good: Singleton Object- class with one method on it
class Random
	def self.something
	end
end
```
Underuse of modules...

###Homework Review###
table names should be plaural (e.g.table USERS)

id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY -> always be called ID, is an integer and auto increments

'never use ruby for something SQL can do'

you want to group by integer values rather than string values

AS aliases the columns

subqueries- as long as a query returns one and only one value you can use that for another query

###INDEXes###

- index a column when it is being used in columns or queries
- should index foreign keys (they are not automatically indexed)
- cost: everytime you add a record it has to reindex
- indexes compromise the write speed in favor of read speed

Two optimization steps:

- denormalize (add more columns)
- index - optimize for write or read?
	- the more indexes your keys are using the more efficient your DB will be

- You optimize the joins by denormalizing (and thus removing the need for joins) and indexing

```
cp -r <old dir name> <new dir name>
```

update
```
UPDATE Persons
SET Address='Nissestien 67', City='Sandnes'
WHERE LastName='Tjessem' AND FirstName='Jakob'
```
