Alan Kay

The hyperlink makes the internet unique. Embedding context and meta-data is what make the internet special.

###Object Orientation###
Chinese proverb:
>The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names.

Defining new kinds of things and bringing these to code. We should be able to create our own things. Teach those things how to work. And use those things.

- class Names are arbitrary and simply point to a block of behaviors. They are just variables
- the difference between variable types is the scope. The context in which they were created.
- a class and a module represent the same behavior and scope gate
- a constant defined in a class are only accessible in that class
- classes can't inherit from modules

```ruby Namespacing with ::
Dog::Colors
#go into the name class and get me colors
```

- An instance variable is totally dependent on which object you are referring to. Every time you assign an instance variable you are teaching properties to the object. 
	- It is not the responsibility of each dog (snoopy, pluto, etc.) to know anything about any other dog.
	- It is the classes responsibility to know about the class, but not about each individual dog.
