###Threads  and  processes:
A  computer  will  often  appear  to  be  doing  many  things  simultaneously,  such  as  checking  for  new  e‐mail  messages,  saving  a  Word  document,  and  loading  a  website. Each  program  is  a  separate  "process".   Each  process  has  one  or  more  "threads. "  If  a  process  has  several  threads,  they  appear  to  run  simultaneously.  For  example,  an  e‐mail  client  may  have  one  thread  that  checks  for  new  e‐mail  messages  and  one  thread  for  the  GUI  so  that  it  can  show  a  button  being  pressed.  In  fact,  only  one  thread  is  being  run  at  any  given  time.  The  processor  switches  between  threads  so  quickly  that  they  appear  to  be  running  simultaneously. Multiple  threads  in  a  single  process  have  access  to  the  same  memory.   By  contrast,  multiple  processes  have  separate  regions  of  memory  and  can  only  communicate  by  special  mechanisms.  The  processor  loads  and  saves  a  separate  set  of  registers  for  each  thread. Remember,  each  process  has  one  or  more  threads,  and  the  processor  switches  between  threads.
