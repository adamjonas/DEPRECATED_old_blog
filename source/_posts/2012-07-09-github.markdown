I had not added my ***SSH key*** for the new Mac Air so that was preventing me from pushing. It gave me no issue with pulling or cloning, only pushing. The SSH was accessed by typing:
```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
After adding it to <https://github.com/settings/ssh> I had no problems...

Pushed a bunch of branches with:
```
git push origin <name of the branch>
```
I could check what was in the repo and what had been pushed to the remote using the command: git branch with the all flag...
```
git branch -a
```


First thing in the morning you do is:
```ruby
git fetch
```
This pulls the latest version without any merges.

creating a branch and pushing it to master....
```
♕ git co -b authentication
♕ git add .
♕ git commit -m 'message'
♕ git push origin authentication
♕ git co master
♕ git merge authentication --no-ff
♕ git push
```
