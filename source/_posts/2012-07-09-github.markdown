Good cheat sheet is: <http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/>
There is a nice site <http://try.github.com> to practice.

I had not added my ***SSH key*** for the new Mac Air so that was preventing me from pushing. It gave me no issue with pulling or cloning, only pushing. The SSH was accessed by typing:
```
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
After adding it to <https://github.com/settings/ssh> I had no problems...

Pushed a bunch of branches with:
```
git push origin <name of the branch>
```
I could check what was in the repo and what had been pushed to the remote using the command: git branch with the all flag...
```
git branch -a
```
