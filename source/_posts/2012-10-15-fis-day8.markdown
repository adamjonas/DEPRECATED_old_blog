[String Concatenation the Right Way; the Fast and Furious Way](http://frozen-citadel-3574.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/10/09/string-concatenation-the-right-way-the-fastest-way/)

```ruby .upto method
1.upto(100){|i| puts fizzbuzz(i)}
```

```ruby Building a prime method
def assert(expectation)
	"true" if expectation
end

class Integer
	def prime?
		(2...self/2).each do |i|
			return false if self % i == 0 #=> number is not prime
		end
		return true
	end

puts assert 1.prime?
puts assert 2.prime?
puts assert 3.prime?
puts assert !(4.prime?)
```

**SELF is always the receiver the method called on**


```ruby Dot Notation -- calling on the right receiver
1...4.inspect #will break because 'inspect' is being called on 4, not the range.
(1..4).inspect is the proper syntax
```

each just returns the original array 

```ruby inject
[1,2,3] #=> {:1=>1, :2=>4, :3=>9}
arr = [1,2,3]
squares = {}

arr.each do |i|
	squares["#{i}".to_sym] = i*i
end
puts squares

arr.inject({}) do |hash, i|
	i*i
end

puts squares
```

###Collect / Map##
each just returns the **original array**
We want to be expression oriented.
```ruby 
squares = [] # this is NOT expression oriented
squares.collect{ |i| i*i }

s = [1,2,3].collect{ |i| i*i ; i} #i is a newline character #=> [1,2,3]
```

**If you are chaining onto the return value, even if it is on one line.**

```ruby
.detect (will return the first value for which the block is true)
```

.select will return all, .detect will return the first.
.reject returns all the values for which the block is false (the opposite of select)

.select will return an empty array if no values are found, but .detect will return nil since it will only return one value...

.all? is sort of like a case statement except you get to use your own comparison
