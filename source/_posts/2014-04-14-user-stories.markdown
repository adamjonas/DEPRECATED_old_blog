Each user story should INVEST

I - **Independent** The user story should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another user story.
N - **Negotiable**  User stories, up until they are part of an iteration, can always be changed and rewritten.
V - **Valuable**  A user story must deliver value to the end user.
E - **Estimable** You must always be able to estimate the size of a user story.
S - **Sized** appropriately or Small  User stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of certainty.
T - **Testable**  The user story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.

> Iteration 0 -> is foundational work that is performed prior to development starting.
