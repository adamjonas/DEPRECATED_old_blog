	name

	a question
	b question

circles for pictures
css - mask transparent circle on top of it

write a site that degrades gracefully.
progressive enhancement- don't build for the worst browser rather than the worst

```css Smilies implementation
	/* in the css */
div smilies-5{
		width: 300px;
		background: repeat-x url(smilies)
}
```

communicate on the web protocols
ssh
http
http
git://
ftp
aim://

https required more resources
// => piggy back the protocol that is being used. over course if this is local it will break on the file system

tr;dl => too long, don't read

*Programmer of the day*
Edgar F. Codd: designed the relational database model

- relational model: has data with keys 
one column has a primary key and all the other data works off of that primary 
- don't want to repeat data so you a second normal form is what you want over third normal form. [network model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model)

- Hierarchical model is the other kind, that no one uses

"A relation is in second normal form if the relation depends on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd".[source](http://www.dba-oracle.com/oracle_tips_codd_obit.htm)

Beautiful code- 
is in proportion to the complexity of the problem.

left joins, inner joins, etc.

```sql Prefixes
//prefix. It would be ambiguous if you had the content column in 
SELECT question.content multiple tables
FROM quiz, question, quiz_question
WHERE
```

***The fewer tables you query, the more efficient the query is***

difference between a where and a join
