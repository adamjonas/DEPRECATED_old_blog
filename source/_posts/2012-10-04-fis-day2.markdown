summary of yesterday
plan for today
	-everyone should be cloning on their own

git clone
create new repo
 - git remove remote origin
 - git add remote origin

make changes push to our repo 
submit pull request to flatiron repo


DB design:

student:
	id (pk, incrementer)
	name

Quiz:
	id (pk, incrementer)
	a question
	b question
	c question
	d question
	e queston
	answer

Student/answers
	student id
	quiz id


circles for pictures
css - mask transparent circle on top of it

write a site that degrades gracefully.
progressive enhancement- don't build for the worst browser rather than the worst

```css Smilies implementation
	/* in the css */
div smilies-5{
		width: 300px;
		background: repeat-x url(smilies)
}
```

communicate on the web protocols
ssh
http
http
git://
ftp
aim://

https required more resources
// => piggy back the protocol that is being used. over course if this is local it will break on the file system

tr;dl => too long, don't read

*Programmer of the day*
Edgar F. Codd: designed the relational database model

- relational model: has data with keys 
one column has a primary key and all the other data works off of that primary 
- don't want to repeat data so you a second normal form is what you want over third normal form. [network model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model)

- Hierarchical model is the other kind, that no one uses

"A relation is in second normal form if the relation depends on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key, so help me Codd."[source](http://www.dba-oracle.com/oracle_tips_codd_obit.htm)

Beautiful code- 
is in proportion to the complexity of the problem.

left joins, inner joins, etc.

```sql Prefixes
//prefix. It would be ambiguous if you had the content column in 
SELECT question.content multiple tables
FROM quiz, question, quiz_question
WHERE
```

***The fewer tables you query, the more efficient the query is***

difference between a where and a join

refernential integrity problem

```
student
id 		name
1 		Adam Jonas

quiz 
id 		name
1 			First quiz

question
id	question_content	 					correct_answer_id 	quiz_id
1 	"What's the color of the sky" 		1 								1

answers
id 		response_content 		question_id
1 		"blue" 									1
2 		"red" 									1


student_answers
question_id 	student_id 		student_response_id  correct
	  1 						1 							2

```

*Different SQL JOINs*

Before we continue with examples, we will list the types of JOIN you can use, and the differences between them.

JOIN: Return rows when there is at least one match in both tables (this is also known as inner join)
LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table
FULL JOIN: Return rows when there is a match in one of the tables
