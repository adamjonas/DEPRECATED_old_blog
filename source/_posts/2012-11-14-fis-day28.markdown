##Authentication
  - http is stateless
  - we pass along with the request is our cookie
    - the cookie lives on the client, which means we can't trust it

  - cookie has a lot of raw data
    - you don't really want to put data on the client
    - except the token: which is just a primary key for their session on my server
  - session id in the cookie identifies the session

  - cookies on the browser/sessions are on the server
    - the cookie is used to access the session

- Form_for requires an ActiveRecord instance -> it needs a model
  - form_tag(sessions_path)

```ruby Session Controller
skip_before_filter :login_required, :only => :new, :create
#this is needed you will need to login before you login. #Need to do this in the user controller as well.

def create
  user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])

  if user
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
  else 
    flash[:notice] => 'login failed'
    redirect :new
  end
end

def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  reset_session
end
```

```ruby Application Controller
class Application Controller
  def login_required
    unless current_user
      redirect_url login_path, :notice => "please login"
  end

  def current_user
    @current_user ||= User.find_by_id(session[:user_id])
  end
  helper_method :current_user

  def logged_in?
    true if current_user
  end
  helper_method :logged_in?

end
```

  - In user model: `has_secure_password`
    - bcrypt
    - password confirmation is optional with has_secure_password
    - if a hacker gains access to your logs and you don't have the password field filtered, they can see all the passwords

- [hashing passwords](http://www.dshield.org/diary.html?storyid=11110)

`Order.update(12, :name => "Barney", :email => "barney@bedrock.com")`

  - is equivalent to

`Order.find(12).update_attributes(:name => "Barney", :email => "barney@bedrock.com")`
