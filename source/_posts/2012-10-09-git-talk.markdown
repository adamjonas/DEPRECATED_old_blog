Git Talk with Julia West

git pull = git fetch + git merge
git pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase #generally don't get the merge commit

git rebase -i "HEAD~5" #=> shows 5 most recent commits in the branch

squash commits- helps you combine commits

merging with fastforwarding
no fast forward is the default at github.

master- ready to go into production
all the work we do is on the feature branch

An important part of the anatomy of a commit is who is its parent

"I keep merging master into my feature branch so that I can have all the commit histories." A rebase will lose the commit histories.
