###Google Analytics
  - We passed in the [onclick trackers](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide) as [options](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4274002/rails-link-to-ruby-variable-in-onclick-javascript)
  - This the gem we used to install the UA code in the footer, also used this for [reference](https://raw.github.com/carrot/hw-packages-private/master/google_analytics.rb?login=tmilewski&token=2e0a477e5793c263c3ba48d191995233).

###Arel
  - [Some cool arel queries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4402815/is-there-a-particularly-elegant-way-to-do-a-count-query-with-rails-3-arel. 
  - used a lamba as shown [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284696/how-can-i-search-date-range-in-rails-with- variable-date), because otherwise the queries will be cached and we were running queries for a day to day basis.
  - ARel has some good [documentation.](https://github.com/rails/arel)

###Local Storage
  - see the local storage article
  - I think this was the first time I used the [push method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7398354/in-coffeescript-how-do-you-append-a-value-to-an-array) in coffeescript.


###Z-index
  - in order to use z-index you need to use the position absolute, relative, or fixed as mentioned [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp)

###SASS
  - `>*` selects all the elements in the selector

###PG backups
  - Backing up a larger DB on heroku -> [docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups)

  **update 11/7/13**
  - `heroku pgbackups:capture` to capture the DB (make sure to specify app if you have multiple heroku apps)
  - `heroku pgbackups` will list the backups that have been made.

###Anchor in a path helper
  - pass it in as an option `redirect_to post_path(comment.post, :anchor => "comment-#{comment.id}")` -> [from](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4981029/how-do-you-use-anchors-for-ids-in-routes-in-rails-3)

###Regex
  - remember there is no whitespacing in regex
    - `background_\w|clicked_space` not `background_\w | clicked_space`

###Background images in mobile
  - need to make sure to explicity define the background image and background size for mobile
