- Created deploy user or go as root?
  - scp => ssh copy from home dir to files online


###Goals for payments
  - verification is done.
    - set up payment long form for when a user submits a bounty for the first time.
      - short form for 2nd payment and beyond?
    - need to notify the bounty author when a bounty has been claimed && verified.

###Setting up a staging server
  - need to configure nginx to handle another environment

  - configured `nginx.conf`
  - copy up or pull down files: `scp /fileonmycomp deploy@git.bo:filename`

  - `sudo nginx -s stop`
  - `sudo nginx` -> starts nginx

  - update the DNS so that it points to that IP address

###Railscast on setting up another env #72
  - can make as many environments as you want
    - add a `staging.rb`
    - copy `production.rb`, but enable debug for the log
    - need to create block in the `database.yml` file as well
    - `rails s -e staging` will start the server in that env
    - `rails c staging` will start the console in that env
    -
