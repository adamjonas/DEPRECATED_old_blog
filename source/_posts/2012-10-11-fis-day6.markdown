CSS selectors are hard
[need to keep this handy](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)


*DB prepare:*
If the same statement is going to be executed repeatedly, you can speed things up a bit by preparing the statement.


[<<HEREDOC](http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-multiline-strings-here-doc-or.html)

xpath: for very specific selectors 

```ruby Multi Assignment
first_name, last_name = doc.css('h1').text.split
```

```ruby Symbol to proc
.map(&:text) 
# equal to
.map { |e| e.text }
```

```ruby .try
.try("attr", "href")
```
In rails, but not in the ruby library.

SQL sanitation:
```
"INSERT INTO students (tagline, bio) VALUES (?)", "I'm the ruby guy", "I'm awesome")
```
DB drivers in SQLite3 does the sanitation.

```ruby Delete DB if it exists
FileUtils.rm("database.db") if File.exists("database.db")
```

SGML -> standard generalized markup language
XML -> extensible markup language
HTML is an extension of XML.

dtd - document type definition
html5 is a new dtd published standards committee

ternary operator
logical expression (true or false)
#this is good for
```ruby
if true (do this)
else (that)
end
```

reg ex are pretty much patterns-- all languages implement them the same
Remember [rubular](http://rubular.com/) for regular expressions (regex).
