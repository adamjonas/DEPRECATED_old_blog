###Programmer of the Day###
_Why the Lucky Stiff

[Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla):
1909 predicted the internet and wireless communication

###Scrapping###
[Possible Workflow](http://www.andrewsturges.com/2011/09/how-to-harvest-web-data-using-ruby-and.html)
NokoGiri
sqlite3 ruby gem

###Stuff I read###
One page script
[Difference between map and collect](http://coryschires.com/whats-the-difference-between-each-and-collect/)

CSS selectors are hard
[need to keep this handy](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)


*DB prepare:*
If the same statement is going to be executed repeatedly, you can speed things up a bit by preparing the statement.


[<<HEREDOC](http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-multiline-strings-here-doc-or.html)

xpath: for very specific selectors 

```ruby Multi Assignment
first_name, last_name = doc.css('h1').text.split
```

```ruby Symbol to proc
.map(&:text) 
# equal to
.map { |e| e.text }
```

```ruby .try
.try("attr", "href")
```
In rails, but not in the ruby library.

SQL sanitation:
```
"INSERT INTO students (tagline, bio) VALUES (?, ?)", "I'm the ruby guy", "I'm awesome")
```
DB drivers in SQLite3 does the sanitation.

```ruby Delete DB if it exists
FileUtils.rm("database.db") if File.exists("database.db")
```

###Avi's code###
nokogiri supports a "/div li.a" syntax, which is more common than the doc.css('div li.a')

###Mark Up Languages###
SGML -> standard generalized markup language
XML -> extensible markup language
HTML is an extension of XML.

dtd - document type definition
html5 is a new dtd published standards committee

###Ternary Operator###
logical expression (true or false)
this is good for the pattern:
```
if true (do this)
else (that)
end
```

reg ex are pretty much patterns-- all languages implement them the same
Remember [rubular](http://rubular.com/) for regular expressions (regex).

if you have email1 and email2 and phone1 and phone2, it's time to break out another table. Store vertically, not horizontally.

***If you see an each block with a push in it, you should be using a collect***

[CSS Selector](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

- element1~element2	
	- (e.g. p~ul)
	- Selects every <ul> element that are preceded by a <p> element

###Homework###
nice [case statement reference](http://www.skorks.com/2009/08/how-a-ruby-case-statement-works-and-what-you-can-do-with-it/)
