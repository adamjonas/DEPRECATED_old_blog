###Simple Search
[Ryan Bates to the rescue](http://railscasts.com/episodes/37-simple-search-form)

###Find
Getting back to basics (or at least closer to SQL). I haven't used find much in the couple months, but it was what I needed for the set up search on the index pages.

The [documentation is awesome](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/find/class).

###ActiveRelation Queries
[Good article on underused queries](http://blog.mitchcrowe.com/blog/2012/04/14/10-most-underused-activerecord-relation-methods/)
