To create multiple directories via the CLI using mkdir simply include the -p flag. For example, starting in home directory where 'development already exists run the following:

$ mkdir -p development/practice/learn_sql

To create multiple directories down the tree do thisâ€¦

$ mkdir -p development/practice/learn_sql/{beginner,intermediate,advanced}
