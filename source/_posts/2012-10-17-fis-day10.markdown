Yaml is more about structured data. Markdown is more about content.

Koans don't really demonstrate variable scope.

###Programmer of the day###
Kent Beck:

- invented smalltalk
- smalltalk design patterns, refactoring, test-driven development, extreme programming, the agile manifesto


>**The nature of errors are unmet expectations** you made an assumption and for some reason that is not longer true.

###Test Driven Development###
define your expectation

- **writing tests is writing the code I wish I had**
- **testing is not about quality assurance**

If you are using a case statement your code isn't object oriented.

##Ruby##

###Hooks###
```ruby initialize
def initialize(arg1, arg2)
	#by specifying that initialize 
	#in initialize its very much ok to use initialize
end
```

```ruby class Methods
class Artist
	def self.top_5
	end
end

class Artist
	class << self
	#this method is hard to read if you are scrolled all the way down.
	#it doesn't explicitly say it's a class method in the method signature
		def top_5
		end
	end
end
```
