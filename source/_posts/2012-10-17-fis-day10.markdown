Yaml is more about structured data. Markdown is more about content.

Koans don't really demonstrate variable scope.

###Programmer of the day###
Kent Beck:

- invented smalltalk
- smalltalk design patterns, refactoring, test-driven development, extreme programming, the agile manifesto


>**The nature of errors are unmet expectations** you made an assumption and for some reason that is not longer true.

###Test Driven Development###
define your expectation

- **writing tests is writing the code I wish I had**
- **testing is not about quality assurance**

If you are using a case statement your code isn't object oriented.

##Ruby##

###Hooks###
```ruby initialize
def initialize(arg1, arg2)
	#by specifying that initialize 
	#in initialize its very much ok to use initialize
end
```

```ruby class Methods
class Artist
	def self.top_5
	end
end

class Artist
	class << self
	#this method is hard to read if you are scrolled all the way down.
	#it doesn't explicitly say it's a class method in the method signature
		def top_5
		end
	end
end
```

###Mini Library Project###
```ruby Lessons Learned
begin
  assert_equal find_songs(library, "Poker Face").first.name, "Poker Face"
rescue => e
  puts e
end

#notice that find_songs has an implicit receiver. Since it's not a 
#class method, it has to be called OUTSIDE a class...

# ALSO

def search_songs(library, song)
    library.songs.find_all { |ea_song| ea_song if ea_song.name.match(song) }
end

#make sure that I'm calling the .find_all on an ATTRIBUTE of an object. 'Come on Jonas,' you are better than that.
```
