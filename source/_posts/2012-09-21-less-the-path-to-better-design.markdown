Design is the art of arranging code

Code needs to work today just once and be easy to change forever.

The purpose is to reduce the cost of change.

Patterns solve a lot of problems:
- SOLID, Demeter

Diagnostics:
Simple ways to judge the goodness of code.
TRUE...

Transparent

The cost of adding a new feature is proportional to its value

Usable
If you wrote the code, you can resuse it.
