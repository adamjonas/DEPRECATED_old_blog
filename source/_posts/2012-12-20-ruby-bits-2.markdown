```ruby Multiple Lambdas
def exec_game(name, action, error_handler)
    game = games.detect { |game| game.name = name }
    begin
      action.call(game)
    rescue
      error_handler.call
    end
  end
```

```ruby Lambda or Proc to Block
library = Library.new(GAMES)
printer = lambda { |game| puts "#{game.name} (#{game.system}) - #{game.year}" }
library.each(&printer)
```

*Calling a method with & in front of a parameter*
`tweets.each(&printer)`

*Defining a method with & in front of a parameter*
`def each(&block)`

```ruby Passing blocks around...
  def each
    games.each do |game|
      yield game
    end
  end

#refactored as
  
  def each(&block)
    games.each(&block)
  end
```

```ruby Symbol to Proc
#going to paste code here...
```
