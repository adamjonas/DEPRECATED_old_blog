		- ask questions

			as a ___,
			I want to ___.

- Code is a craft. 
	- consulting is more challenging than a startup
		- scratching someone else's itch is more challenging

- There are things that you can delegate

- Use [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) and [Jing is like skitch for screencasting](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html) to show off your work and improve feedback.

- **Ask a company about their core values...**

###Estimates###
