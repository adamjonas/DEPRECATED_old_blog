##Agile is...###
***is about getting input from your environment***

- many agile dev techniques, come from Toyota and lean manufacturing
	- if they were based on 1000 cars a day metric and the suppliers or demand change, Toyota needed to avoid

*split the process into small parts to reduce waste and inefficiency*

- set up frequent opportunities for assessment and feedback
- plan only as far ahead as you need to. Your environment WILL change.
- break the process down into the smallest possible units

###Small Pieces###
- break the task down and break the time frames down
- sprints: in an avg dev shop, a sprint might be from 2-3 weeks
	- for a day project, we use sprints from 

**Get feedback so that you can fail faster**

###Process###
1. sprint planning session
2. sprint
3. retrospective

###Stories###
Epic > stories > task

- Story = what is this code going to do?
	- break the story down into tasks to make that happen

###Planning session###
- beginning of the project, you start out with a planning session.
	- the client and the user can identify the NEED TO HAVES and WANT TO HAVES
		- which stories are we going to pull out from the backlog
	- reduce you waste because the client is going to change their mind

###Agile is sort of the like:###
 - ~= small git commits
 - ~= TDD
