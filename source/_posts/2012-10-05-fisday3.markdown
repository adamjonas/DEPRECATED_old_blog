Programs are:

*idealized components*... not bound by degradation of use.

*infinite complexity*... because nothing is stopping us from building it.

*Method signature* is the first line of the method (e.g. def method_name(*arg))

*Parameters* are the adverbs. Parameters allow us to make a method dynamic.

To the computer, there is no difference between a local variable and a method.

'==' => value equality
'===' => object equality

A computationally efficient language will compile down faster than

*lazy evaluation*- the program will stop as soon as an if or elsif is satisfied. It won't execute any more statements.

sqlite 3.4.12 is the first version to support multi-line inserts.

?? Are there languages with more syntactic sugar than ruby?
?? is it really not possible to write a program in SQL
Does [this](http://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2005/12/30/a-sql-game/) qualify as a program?
