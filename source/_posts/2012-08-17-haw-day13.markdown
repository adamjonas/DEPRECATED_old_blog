Checkboxes


return default goes at the end
preventDefault() goes at the beginning

return false goes at the end

we can import the deploys with client.deploys('project#').first

You can also pass local variables into partials, making them even more powerful and flexible. For example, you can use this technique to reduce duplication between new and edit pages, while still keeping a bit of distinct content:

new.html.erb
```
<h1>New zone</h1>
<%= error_messages_for :zone %>
<%= render :partial => "form", :locals => { :zone => @zone } %>
```

###Specifying a class in a link_to###
```ruby Using Twitter Bootstrap
<div class="btn-group pull-right">
<%=link_to " Refresh Errors", errors_import_path, :class => 'btn icon-refresh btn-success' %>
```
