Gists were redesigned with libgit2 gem with Rugged.

```
#In IRB
require 'rugged'
#git init the repo then...
repo = Rugged::Repository.new('/file/path')

#what worked
index = repo.index
repo.bare?
repo.empty?
tree= repo.lookup( repo.index.write_tree ) 

#what didnt
oid = rugged.write("This is a blob.", :blob) #didnt recognize rugged
parents=[ repo.lookup( repo.head.target ).oid ]
```

In this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12649697/how-to-commit-with-ruby-bindings-for-libgit2/12651234) there seem to be some issues with the 0.16 build. They suggest to use the `gem install --prerelease rugged` for commits.
