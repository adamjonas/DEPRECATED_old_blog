Setting Up Octopress

http://octopress.org/docs/setup/

Had one hiccup in my system didn't have Ruby 1.9.2 which .rvmrc file requires (https://rvm.io//workflow/rvmrc/). I had to go ahead and install it.

Deploying on Heroku:

http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/

That all went fairly well... though I didn't understand all the intermediate steps. I'll have to take closer look.
