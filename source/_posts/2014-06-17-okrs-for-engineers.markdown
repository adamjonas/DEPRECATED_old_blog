###Notes

  - lead developer's OKRs mostly product focused
    - and their product responsibilites become one piece of their bonus compensation (also would include overall company success (no bonus is the company didn't make money)).
  - break to feature or objective into smaller product pieces for engineers if possible.

OKRs for engineers below lead devs are difficult. Goals become more task oriented. E.g.

  - 2 ruby meetups a month
  - satisfactory 360 feedback
  - biweekly one on ones (address concerns of manager)
