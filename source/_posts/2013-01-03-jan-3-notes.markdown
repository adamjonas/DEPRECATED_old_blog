###Adding a comma for big numbers
`<%= number_with_delimiter(repo.watchers, :delimiter => ',')`
[From](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1078347/is-there-a-rails-trick-to-adding-commas-to-large-numbers)

###UI/UX strategy
  - kickstarter- encouraging click through rather than interaction.
  - digg, stackoverflow, and reddit are closer to the functionality we want.
  - don't reinvent the wheel -> move forward.

###Bounty Claims

- Psuedo code: collect the info from the user (modal)

- this is sent to verification layer
  - bounty controller?

  1. make sure the issue is closed
  2. make sure that an issue has a bounty
  3. make sure the issue was solved by the bounty claimer

- if true- send verification to both bounty claimer and bounty author
  - write the user id for all bounties the claimer solved
  - change the badge/trigger payment on the profile pages of the bounty issuer
  - tell gitbo admin that this was solved.

- if false tell them why


###A modal mess
  - We were trying to pass in multiple parameters in the url. But why do that?

```ruby This is simpler
<div class="modal-body">
  <%= form_tag(bounty_claim_path) do %>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="owner_name">Repo Owner Name</label>
    <input id="owner_name" name="owner_name" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="repo_name">Repo Name</label>
    <input id="repo_name" name="repo_name" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="git_number">Github Issue Number</label>
    <input id="git_number" name="git_number" type="text" />
  </div>
  <div class="modal-footer">
    <span id="error"></span>
    <div class="actions">
      <button class='btn btn-success btn-small'>Submit</button>
      <button class="btn btn-danger btn-small" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">Oopsy</button>
    </div>
  </div>
  <% end %>
</div>
```
  
  - Just submit to a static url and pass in the info via params.
