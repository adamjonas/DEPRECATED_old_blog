###Names
  - Taken
    - ivy
    - trellis
    - grapevine
    - chlorophyll
    - vinify

###Building the gem
  - Ryan Bates [you stud](http://railscasts.com/episodes/245-new-gem-with-bundler)
  - create the gem with builder **before** you create files within it.

###Removing a file from Github
  - `git rm examples/all.rb`
  - `git rm examples/all.rb --cached` leaves a local version


###class << self
  - see nice stackoverflow responses [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2505067/class-self-idiom-in-ruby) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2567956/rails-class-self)
  - [katz write up](http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/15/metaprogramming-in-ruby-its-all-about-the-self/)

###Reading
  - [API reference](https://github.com/starlock/vino/wiki/API-Reference)
  - [Digging in the Vineyard](http://www.gironda.org/2013/02/25/digging-in-the-vineyard-part-1.html)

###Hacking vine
  - thumbnails and videos are posted to s3, they cannot be self hosted for example, so one could repost other videos from the validated s3 bucket.
    - thumbnails seem to be able to be hosted from anywhere...

  - 20 second vines. 
    - [here](http://www.addictivetips.com/ios/how-to-share-vine-videos-longer-than-6-seconds/) and [here](http://animalnewyork.com/2013/how-to-make-a-20-second-vine/)
    - this hack has been closed. They just crash the app now.

  - hacking the AWS s3 bucket
    - wonder if they can be hosted by any s3 bucket? likely not, but worth a try.

###Publishing the Gem
  - Used [Hemingway](https://github.com/carrot/hw/blob/master/hw.gemspec) as a nice template. 
    - notice he used gem instead of spec as the variable name
    - added the dependencies in the gemspec
