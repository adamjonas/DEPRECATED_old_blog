In the first five minutes of my first programming class I knew I was in trouble. I didn't know what a method was. I didn't know what an array was. My teacher babbled on about controllers and TCP packets as I nervously glanced around wondering if I was the only with that terrible pit in my stomach.

After class, I went up to [Avi](http://flatironschool.com/#people) and told him of my situation. He offered two choices: a refund ***or*** I could push through and take the class as many times as needed. At this point, I don't think I'll be getting my money back...

##Why you should consider a change##

**1. You probably aren't very happy with your job.**
There are lots of people who are perfectly happy with their jobs. The chances are, you aren't one of them. I can't believe how many of the people in my life complain about something they spend a minimum of 8 hours a day doing. Few take action to make a change. Don't let your future be defined by inaction.

**2. Tech is about as close to a meritocracy as you are going to find.**
Unless you are the beneficiary of exceptional privilege, you probably wish that people would judge you on your merits rather than your: race, origin, sexual orientation, gender, hairstyle, or the color of your socks. In tech, people actually care about your skills. One's pedigree means little in the absence of substance. It is how life should be. The best teacher *should* get paid the most. The best actors *should* get the leading roles. The best candidate *should* get the job. In tech, this *actually* happens.

**3. You don't have to be a leecher anymore...**
Since my Dad first popped in that AOL floppy disk around 1995, I have been a consumer of the internet. I've sucked down untold hours of [baseball news](http://mlb.com) and [dog videos](http://gawker.com/5952338/had-a-ruff-day-this-dog-video-is-guaranteed-to-improve-your-mood). [{% img right /images/aoldisk.jpg 250 AOL Floppy %}](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanchan/) I've used web applications to communicate with my family, conduct business, and plan my social life. I've logged onto the internet nearly every day of the second-half of my life. I decided last year that I was done being a suck on the system. [Mldraft](http://mldraft.com) was my first attempt to contribute something and it wasn't great. The experience did, however, fundamentally change my perspective on being a consumer. I'll be a leecher no more and neither should you.

There are so many resources to get started. There are limitless [online tutorials](http://ajonas.herokuapp.com/blog/2012/10/10/code-school-vs-treehouse-vs-code-academy/) and [Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/). You don't need to be a math whiz or a hermit to be a programmer. If you have ever learned a foreign language; if you have ever spent hours at a time mastering a song on guitar; if you have ever spent a full afternoon improving your free-throw you can learn to code.
