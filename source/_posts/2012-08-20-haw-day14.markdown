###JQuery Token Input###
http://railscasts.com/episodes/258-token-fields
need to make sure the controller responds to .json
-the default has it nested in an @tags key. To remove that we need to map it to its attributes like so--
```ruby
format.json { render :json => @tags.collect{|t| t.attributes}  }
```

prePoulation was an issue as well


```ruby Symobol to Proc
[1,2].collect{|i| i.to_s} #=> ["1", "2"]
```

To Jquery plugin to gem


query isn't searching properly in the tags controller
remove the submit button for tag tokens

f.text_field options for onAdd or on Remove



put the :controller => :error, :action => :resolve_on_airbrake on the fix button
or gather all the errors tagged with fixed and move this task to a background job...

sidekiq runs on redis
create a worker folder
??needs to be serialized into redis?
sidekiq will run if there is an error: can disable the retry option with an option
pool thread limits the number of jobs that can be run
