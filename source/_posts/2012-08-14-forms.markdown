###Forms###
forms are a collection of elements
text element cant live by itself
the entire sign up for needs to be submitted to one place
group form elements together and you wrap them in a form

where its going has nothing to do with the information that it is passing in

every web request as a request and a response
a request has to go somewhere-- that's urls-- that's the address
forms pass along data for where we are going-- go here and tell the server this

[Input tags](htmlhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp)

***the name in the form is the key of the params hash***
```
#The html 
<input type="text", name="tag">
#in the controller
@airbrake_error.add_tags(params[:tag])
```

```ruby
#if the form contains 
<%= text_field_tag(:query) %>
#then you would be able to get the value of this field in the controller with params[:query].
```

- text_field_tag :name of the tag and then the prefilled value

- f.text_field :comments is NESTED in airbrake error which is represented by f

- The form doesn't need a name-- it is the wrapper. The input elements DO need names.
