```ruby FizzBuzz - The Stairway to Heaven of Programmers
# Define the fizzbuzz method to do the following: 10pts
# Use the modulo % method (divisible by)
# 2 % 2 #=> true
# 1 % 2 #=> false

# If a number is divisible by 3, puts "Fizz".
# If a number is divisible by 5, puts "Buzz".
# If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, puts "FizzBuzz"

# Use if statements 2pts
# Use the && operator 3pts


# Write a loop that will group the numbers from 1 through 50
# by whether they fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz - 10pts

def fizz_buzz(number)
	fizzbuzz = []
	buzz = []
	fizz = []

	while number <= 49
		number += 1
		if (number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0)
			fizzbuzz << number
			puts "FizzBuzz"
		elsif number % 5 == 0
			buzz << number
			puts "buzz"
		elsif number % 3 == 0
			fizz << number
			puts "fizz"

	puts "All the buzzes are #{buzz.join(', ')}"
