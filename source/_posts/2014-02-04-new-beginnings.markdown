It has been a little more than a year from when I started at [Carrot Creative](http://carrot.is). It has been an [exciting year in Carrot history](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/media/vice-media-buys-a-tech-company-to-experiment-with-content-distribution.html?_r=0) and year in which I had some personal milestones. Carrot was the perfect place for me over the past year and I'm eternally grateful for the opportunity to work on some large scale using a variety of technologies.

I am excited to be returning to the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com), this time as an instructor. Working with eager students who want to change the world through code is an exciting proposition and one I ultimately couldn't resist.
