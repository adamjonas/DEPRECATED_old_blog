builder pattern versus the inheritance pattern

no diff between slugs and permalinks

To install a gem from a fork
```
gem 'rails', :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'
```

add validation to prevent slug nil

```
git reset --hard HEAD
# could also reset to a specific point in time
git reset --hard <sha>
```
HEAD is the current version

delete local branch:
```
git branch -d initial-error-tagging
#to delete the remote...
â™• git push origin :initial-error-tagging
```

GOALS:
1. normalize the tag_names DONE

2. should be able to mark the error as ignore and rerun the importer and when it's reimported it should still be marked as ignored....
- inbox not show you errors with tag ignore
- if we reimport these errors they need to maintain their tags (is this )
does the count update? 

 look into scopes-- need to filter ignore off the index 
read about named scopes on mongoid
http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/querying.html#scoping
desired code

```ruby
errors.not_ignored
#or better yet
errors.fresh # => to get a list of errors that haven't been ignored.
```

3. li needs to build a show page of each error's attributes

NOTES:
Scoping - so scoping is like a filter
[Mongoid scoping macro](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/querying.html#scoping)

```ruby Filtering/Scope
Tag.not_in(:name => "fresh").includes(:airbrake_errors).collect{|t| t.airbrake_errors}
```
