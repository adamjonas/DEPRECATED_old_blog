  - Everytime you clone a project you get its full history...
    - to get a specific commit
      - `$ git checkout -b aNewBranch SHA1` with SHA1 representing the commit id from which you want to proceed.

  - config env variables on heroku
    - `heroku config:add FACEBOOK_APP_TOKEN='<tokenhere>' --remote staging` 

  - `rake deploy:staging` but need to make sure staging db is up to date `rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=staging`

  - custom actions are for dream big are [here](https://github.com/carrot/target-dream-big/blob/develop/app/controllers/facebook_controller.rb)

  - `git bisect` -> [docs](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git)

###Expect syntax
  - remember to not including whitespaces between expect and the parentheses
    - correct -> `expect(sm.current_number_of_boards).to eq 24`
    - incorrect -> `expect (sm.current_number_of_boards).to eq 24`


###Testing the cache
  - it's not easy to test the cache.
    - one problem is that when you write to the cache you are affecing the dev cache

  - can clear the cache with `Rails.cache.clear` [found here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10443535/manually-clear-fragment-cache-in-rails)

  - [complicated caching](http://broadcastingadam.com/2011/05/advanced_caching_in_rails/)

###Progress bar
  - [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7190898/progress-bar-with-html-and-css?lq=1)

###HAML
  - partial -> `= render :partial => "partial_name"` 
  - yield -> `#masthead= yield :masthead`
  - setting a variable in HAML -> `- check_mark = image_tag("http://placehold.it/21x21", class: 'check')` need the `-`
  - submit button -> ` %input{:type => "submit", :value => "Send", :class => "button"}`

```ruby sweet helper allows you to reduce whitespace
= surround 'GiftCard', '.' do
   %sup &reg;
```
There are a bunch [in the docs.](http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/Haml/Helpers.html)

###Content_for
```ruby Using content_for

<% content_for :not_authorized do %>
  alert('You are not authorized to do that!')
<% end %>

#You can then use content_for :not_authorized anywhere in your templates.
<%= content_for :not_authorized if current_user.nil? %>

#This is equivalent to:
<%= yield :not_authorized if current_user.nil? %>
```

###Escaping a space
  - `&nbsp;`
  - [ascii character in link_to](9http://www.samuelhwong.com/blog/2011/09/29/quick-tip-ascii-codes-and-link-to/), just add `.html_safe`

###Creating or updating many records at a time in rails
```ruby
#creating new records
["array" "of" "strings"].each_with_index do |t,i|
  Tile.create(:title, t)
end

#updating existing records
["array" "of" "strings"].each_with_index do |t,i|
  Tile.find(i+1).update_attribute(:title, t)
end
```

###Collection in routes
```ruby Need collection to lose the id requirement
resources :superlatives, :only => [:create] do
  collection do
    post :skip
  end
end
```

###.length
You can look for the number of instances in the DOM and update it accordingly if there are the right number. I used this when I was updating the DOM and to see if the page had 3 classes indicating that three friends had been nominated.

```
if $('div.friend-nomination').length == 3
  console?.log? 'this has three'
```

###Heroku console
  - `heroku run rails console --remote <name of branch>`

###CSS Positioning
  - [old but cool little reference](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/)

###Print Stylesheets
  - had a problem with getting the @media print file to recognize the sass styling that I was writing. Discovered that every single element needed to be to explicitly defined for it to work.... what a pain in the ass.

###JQuery Migrate
  -  Was removed from the [jquery core](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/)
