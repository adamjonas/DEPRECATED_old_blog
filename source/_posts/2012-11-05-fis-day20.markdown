###UMLs
- [Unified Model Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)
- Monolithic user classes
  - [definition of monolithic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3179396/what-does-monolithic-mean)


###SQL
  - A has_many :through type query
```
SELECT * FROM song_genres INNER JOIN genres ON genre.id = genre_id FROM song_genre WHERE song_id = 1
```

###Avoiding has_and_belongs_to_many
  - if you name a column order, connection, attribute, etc., you will run into issues, because those words are reserved

  - [Jose Susser isn't as adamant](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2006/4/20/many-to-many-dance-off)
 

###Lessons Learned
  - Parameters in a method HAVE TO BE comma delimited:
```ruby
form_tag(url_for_options = {}, options = {}, &block)
```

  - When using build, you just need to save the parent
