## Faceted Search

Search of specific facets like a brand or size for a show search. These are limited set of values, not like a username or ID which could be anything. It's like a taxomony search.

## Stemming

Reduces the word to its root. So 'fishes' and 'fishing' to 'fish.'

This algorithm really hasn't been around that long. First proposed in '68 it gained popularity in the 80s.
