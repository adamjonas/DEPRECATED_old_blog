###Git Services
- [Service Hooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks)
- [github services repo](https://github.com/github/github-services)

##Dan Integration Tests
- test an app end to end
- deal with your libs and your code
- hit external services

  - unit tests may not test bad arguments
  - bad db queries or scope
  - issues with external service

- Unit tests are fast

- speed
  - don't use external services like the DB, that is what mocks and stubs are for

- mocks, stubs and [mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha)

- controller specs -> unit tests for controllers
  - we have 20:1 Unit:integration test ratio

###Factory Girl 
  - reuseable test data
  - defines attributes for a class
  - can define relationships, like a user has an address
  - `FactoryGirl.create(:user)`
  - `FactoryGirl.build(:user)`
  - `FactoryGirl.build_stubbed(:user)`
  - `FactoryGirl.attributes_for(:user)`

###Mocha-> stubs and mocks
  - [RDoc](http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/)
  - stubs -> sit in for this method, whenever you call this method, return this val
    - user.bank_balance => returns 100.
      - `MyClass.stub(:x => "ABC")`
  - mocks -> like stubs, but must be called the specified number of times
    - a mock if it is called or not called will fail a test
    - use when you need something that is a little more specific
      - `MyClass.expects(:y).with("arg").returns("ABC")`

  - `Mocha::Configuation.prevent(:stubbing_non_existent_method)`

###In Summary
- Test basic behavior with intergration tests
- Test complex behavior with unit tests

args.each_with_object({}) do |(key, selector), attrs|
  attrs[key] = job_doc.css(selector).text
end
