Like any n00b, I spent a lot of time learning the skills of programming online. Outside of random YouTube Videos ([NewBoston](http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) is worth your time), there are three well-known online products-- [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), and [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). I'd estimate, I've spent around 80 hours on these sites. I don't know if that is a lot or a little, but I do know that Code School is the clear winner...

###Codecademy###
(not to be confused with [Code Academy](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/code-academy-evolves-starter-league-and-partners-37signals)) [exploded on the scene last fall](http://www.businessinsider.com/codecademy-1000000-users-2012-1), but really falls short in the [usability](http://programmingzen.com/2012/01/16/on-the-usability-of-codecademy/) department and error feedback. To be fair, I only have spent time with their JavaScript courses, but it's hard to get past first impressions. Granted, Codecademy is run by a [couple of youngins'](http://mashable.com/2012/07/25/zach-sims-codecademy/) and haven't had the head start that Code School has on its interactive browser, but I found myself more than frustrated going through their lessons. If they spent less time, hammering my inbox with weekly emails and built a better interface, I'd be more likely to take a look at their newly updated and [well funded site]((http://www.crunchbase.com/company/codecademy) (I've heard they added Ruby lessons). At least for now, Codecademy is FREE. So serious brownie points there.

**EDIT**: I recently revisited [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and the usability (which is clearly my biggest gripe above, has really been refined and improved. In fact, I was impressed with the ease of use this go around... If I were starting from scratch I would start here, while Code School caters to an intermediate skill level and above.)

###Treehouse is...###
in a word, boring. Thankfully, I was able to guess most of the answers without struggling through the videos. I did spend, however, a portion of the time learning about subjects on the periphery. Their explanations of structs, I/O, and Ruby Core had slipped through the cracks of other beginner Ruby tutorials. I couldn't get into the humor of [Mike the Frog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQNXtyoyHic) or some of their other movie "rewards," but I guess that really shouldn't be the main motivating factor. While others thought it is silly, I like that [Jason Seifer](https://twitter.com/jseifer) is such a goofball. He is the lone source of humor in an overall dry learning experience. Personally, I learn faster by doing and Treehouse falls short here. Though they do sprinkle in a few interactive quizzes, it just isn't enough. If you are going to financially invent in your learning, I'd save it for...

###Code School###
**rocks**. It has clearly been the best use of my time. The videos are much more in-depth and the interactive browser is the superior to everything else I've seen. The [Envy Labs Team](http://envylabs.com/) goes into significantly more detail than their aforementioned competitors. Their material is engaging, challenging, and well thought-out. What I enjoyed most (besides the information of course) is the self-depreciating humor that dots their casts. Cheesy graphics and dedication to a theme, for example Zombie terminology, finds the right balance of hilarious and non-interfering entertainment. When I first took their beginner courses, I grumbled at the level of detail they covered. Now that I picked up a few things, Code School does an amazing job of covering the entire breadth of subjects within a topic. Maybe most importantly, the error feedback is actually useful as are their hints. My sole criticism is that there is a recognizable difference between [Gregg Pollack](https://twitter.com/greggpollack) and the others characters. If he could navigate the office politics, Gregg should do all the casts.

Now in my 7th month of my programming career, [Avi's words](http://shitavisays.tumblr.com/) have more meaning than ever:
>"It's not about learning the syntax. Anyone can learn that. Learning to program is learning how to communicate." -- Avi Flombaum

If you are going to learn the syntax (which we DO need to do), Code School is very much worth it and [I'm not the only one who thinks so](http://paulstamatiou.com/code-school-learn-by-doing). But what do I know? Not that much. What do you think?
