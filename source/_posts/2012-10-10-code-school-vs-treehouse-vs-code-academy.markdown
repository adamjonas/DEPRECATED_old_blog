Like any n00b, I spent a lot of time learning the skills of programming online. Outside of random YouTube Videos ([NewBoston](http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) is worth your time), there are three well-known online products-- [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/), and [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). I'd estimate, I've spent around 80 hours on these sites. I don't know if that is a lot or a little, but I do know that Code School is the clear winner...

###Codecademy###
[exploded on the scene in last fall](http://www.businessinsider.com/codecademy-1000000-users-2012-1), but really falls short in the [usability](http://programmingzen.com/2012/01/16/on-the-usability-of-codecademy/) department and the explanations of the problems. To be fair, I only have spent time with their javascript basics, but it's hard to past my first impressions. Granted, they are run by a [couple of kids](http://mashable.com/2012/07/25/zach-sims-codecademy/) and haven't had the head start that Code School has on its interactive browser. In my opinion, if they spent less time crushing my inbox with weekly emails and built a better interface, I'd be more likely to take a look at their newly updated and [well funded site]((http://www.crunchbase.com/company/codecademy). At least for now, Codecademy is FREE. So serious brownie points there. (*Postscript:* This isn't the [Code Academy](http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/code-academy-evolves-starter-league-and-partners-37signals) I'm talking about.)

###Treehouse is...###
boring and I was able to guess most of the answers. Still, I spent some portion of the time learning about subjects on the periphery. Their explanations of structs, I/O, and Ruby Core had slipped through the cracks of other beginner tutorials. I couldn't get into the humor of [Mike the Frog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQNXtyoyHic) or some of their other silly movie "rewards," but I guess that really shouldn't be the main motivating factor. While others thought it is silly, I like that [Jason Seifer](https://twitter.com/jseifer) is such a goofball. Overall, I learn faster by doing and Treehouse falls short here-- though they do sprinkle in a few interactive quizzes. If you are going to spend the dollars though. I'd save it for...

###Code School###
rocks and has clearly been the best use of my time. The videos are much more in-depth and the interactive browser is a clear winner. The [Envy Labs Team](http://envylabs.com/) goes into much more detail than their aforementioned competitors. Their material is engaging, challenging, and well thought-out. What I enjoy most (besides the information of course) is the self-depreciating humor that dots all their cast. Cheesy graphics and a dedication to Zombie Terminology dot most of their lessons. When I first took their beginner courses, I was frustrated by the level of detail they covered. Now that I picked a few things, Code School does an amazing job of covering the breath of subjects within a topic. Greg Pollack stands out as the best presenter. My only criticism is that there is a recognizable difference between Greg and the others. If he could navigate the politics, Greg should do all the casts.

Now in my 7th month into my programming career, I finally understand [Avi's words](http://shitavisays.tumblr.com/):
>"It's not about learning the syntax. Anyone can learn that. Learning to programming is learning how to communicate." -- Avi Flombaum

If you are going to learn the syntax (as we all need to do), Code School is very much worth it and [I'm not the only one who thinks so](http://paulstamatiou.com/code-school-learn-by-doing). So what do I know? Not that much. What do you think?
