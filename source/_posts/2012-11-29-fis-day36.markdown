###Lessons Learned
- We were having trouble adding styling to the vote button after a click, like on stackoverflow.
  - the javascript was located in the vote.js file and would only trigger after the second event
    - *ANSWER:* The vote is only created after the vote button is clicked the first time, thus if we moved it to issue.js it would work fine.

###Merging an upstream and updating the gem
```
♕ git fetch upstream
♕ git merge upstream/master
#resolve your conflicts

#bundle update gem --source git_user_name
bundle update octokit --source ajonas04
```

```javascript A Simple Click Event
$("a.upvote").click(function(){
  $(this).toggleClass("selected")
});
```
