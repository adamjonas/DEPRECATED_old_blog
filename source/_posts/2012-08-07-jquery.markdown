###The DOM:###
the web browser remembers the HTML tags, their attributes, and the order in which they appear in the fileâ€”this representation of the page is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short. (js and jquery the missing manual, p127)



[Repel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) - 
read, evaluate, print, loop


everything with remote true should have their submit button hijacked and exectured with ajax
jquery is to rails what ruby is js

```html src
<source src="URL">
```

```javascript [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=XMLHttpRequest)
//To create an instance of XMLHttpRequest, simply do this:
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
```
xhr- used to be just xml


READ: [ajax jesse james garrett](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications)
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript + XML
Ajax incorporates:
- standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS;
- dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model;
- data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;
- asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest;
- and JavaScript binding everything together.

js is all an event model

predictable DOM


[###Difference between li/#b and li.b?###](http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)

/# => ids --> IDs are unique
- Each element can have only one ID
- Each page can have only one element with that ID

dot b => class names --> are NOT unique
- You can use the same class on multiple elements.
- You can use multiple classes on the same element.

###Crazy Selector for our app###
```javascript
$("tr#error_<%error.id %> input:submit[value='Noise']").click(function(){
	confirm("Are you sure?");
})
// input:submit[value='Noise']" are you kidding me?
```
